"摘要
Epidemiological investigation suggested that the current outbreak of COVID-19 virus was associated with a seafood market, and COVID-19 has been identified a probable bat origin. Similar to SARS event in 2003, such a zoonotic disease showed an animal-to-person and even more serious person-to-person spread, and posed a significant threat to the global health and socio-economic development. We analyzed the association of both outbreaks with wildlife diet in China and proposed suggestions for regulating wildlife conservation and food safety to prevent human exposure to the novel virus, including increasing social awareness of hazards in eating wild animals, strengthening legislation on eating and trading of wild animals, improving the standards for food safety, and establishing market supervision mechanism. Regulatory intervention is not only critical for China but also for other countries where wildlife hunting is prevalent to prevent from novel virus exposures.",作者关键词:Wildlife conservation; food safety; zoonotic disease; human exposure; novel virus,文献类型:Article,ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY,UNSP 1741325,Regulating wildlife conservation and food safety to prevent human exposure to novel virus,"作者:Yuan, JJ (Yuan, Jingjing)[ 1,2 ] ; Lu, YL (Lu, Yonglong)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Cao, XH (Cao, Xianghui)[ 2,3 ] ; Cui, HT (Cui, Haotian)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology,National Key R&D Program of China ,出版年: DEC 16 2020,"Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in December 2019, is still ongoing in Korea, with >9,000 confirmed cases as of March 25, 2020. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR is currently the most reliable diagnostic method for COVID-19 around the world. Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine and the Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control propose guidelines for diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical laboratories in Korea. These guidelines are based on other related domestic and international guidelines, as well as expert opinions and include the selection of test subjects, selection of specimens, diagnostic methods, interpretation of test results, and biosafety.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Outbreak; Laboratory diagnosis; Guidelines; Korea,文献类型:Article,ANNALS OF LABORATORY MEDICINE,10.3343/alm.2020.40.5.351,Guidelines for Laboratory Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Korea,"作者:Hong, KH (Hong, Ki Ho)[ 1 ] ; Lee, SW (Lee, Sang Won)[ 2 ] ; Kim, TS (Kim, Taek Soo)[ 3 ] ; Huh, HJ (Huh, Hee Jae)[ 4 ] ; Lee, J (Lee, Jaehyeon)[ 5 ] ; Kim, SY (Kim, So Yeon)[ 6 ] ; Park, JS (Park, Jae-Sun)[ 2 ] ; Kim, GJ (Kim, Gab Jeong)[ 2 ] ; Sung, H (Sung, Heungsup)[ 7,8 ] ; Roh, KH (Roh, Kyoung Ho)[ 9 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Medical Laboratory Technology,,出版年: SEP 2020,"Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Lab Med, 50-1 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.

"摘要
Flow physics plays a key role in nearly every facet of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes the generation and aerosolization of virus-laden respiratory droplets from a host, its airborne dispersion and deposition on surfaces, as well as the subsequent inhalation of these bioaerosols by unsuspecting recipients. Fluid dynamics is also key to preventative measures such as the use of face masks, hand washing, ventilation of indoor environments and even social distancing. This article summarizes what we know and, more importantly, what we need to learn about the science underlying these issues so that we are better prepared to tackle the next outbreak of COVID-19 or a similar disease.",作者关键词:biomedical flows; aerosols; atomization; particle; fluid flow,文献类型:Editorial Material,JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS,F2,The flow physics of COVID-19,"作者:Mittal, R (Mittal, Rajat)[ 1,2 ] ; Ni, R (Ni, Rui)[ 1 ] ; Seo, JH (Seo, Jung-Hee)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Mechanics; Physics,,出版年: JUL 10 2020,"Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.

"摘要
Background: There's an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020. Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak.

Methods: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages.

Results: The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.

Conclusions: Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Nucleic acid test; Positive rate,文献类型:Article,CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA,10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.009,"Positive rate of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4880 cases from one hospital in Wuhan, China, from Jan to Feb 2020","作者:Liu, R (Liu, Rui)[ 1 ] ; Han, H (Han, Huan)[ 1 ] ; Liu, F (Liu, Fang)[ 2,3 ] ; Lv, ZH (Lv, Zhihua)[ 1 ] ; Wu, KL (Wu, Kailang)[ 2 ] ; Liu, YL (Liu, Yingle)[ 2 ] ; Feng, Y (Feng, Yong)[ 4 ] ; Zhu, CL (Zhu, Chengliang)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Medical Laboratory Technology,National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention ,出版年: JUN 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Dept Clin Lab, Renmin Hosp, Wuhan 430060, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases have been reported in Wuhan, China. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over the world, especially in China.

"摘要
Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.",作者关键词:cell susceptibility; coronavirus; dissemination; nervous system,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25728,The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 may play a role in the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients,"作者:Li, YC (Li, Yan-Chao)[ 1 ] ; Bai, WZ (Bai, Wan-Zhu)[ 2 ] ; Hashikawa, T (Hashikawa, Tsutomu)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Virology,,出版年: JUN 2020,"Jilin Univ, Dept Histol & Embryol, Coll Basic Med Sci, Norman Bethune Coll Med, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China.

In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. However, there are agents that were used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics. We could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus.

"摘要
The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical data, discharge rate, and fatality rate of COVID-19 patients for clinical help. The clinical data of COVID-19 patients from December 2019 to February 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients and explained the discharge rate and fatality rate with a single-arm meta-analysis. The available data of 1994 patients in 10 literatures were included in our study. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%). Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.9%). The results of the laboratory showed that the lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of C-reactive protein (44.3%), increase of lactic dehydrogenase (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%) were more common. The results of single-arm meta-analysis showed that the male took a larger percentage in the gender distribution of COVID-19 patients 60% (95% CI [0.54, 0.65]), the discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 52% (95% CI [0.34,0.70]), and the fatality rate was 5% (95% CI [0.01,0.11]).",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; clinical characteristics; COVID-19; discharge rate; fatality rate; meta-analysis,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25757,"COVID-19 patients' clinical characteristics, discharge rate, and fatality rate of meta-analysis","作者:Li, LQ (Li, Long-quan)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Huang, T (Huang, Tian)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Wang, YQ (Wang, Yong-qing)[ 4 ] ; Wang, ZP (Wang, Zheng-ping)[ 5 ] ; Liang, Y (Liang, Yuan)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Huang, TB (Huang, Tao-bi)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhang, HY (Zhang, Hui-yun)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Sun, WM (Sun, Weiming)[ 6 ] ; Wang, YP (Wang, Yuping)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Virology,Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province ,出版年: JUN 2020,"Lanzhou Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Endocrinol, 1 West Donggang Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.

"摘要
From the beginning of 2002 and 2012, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) crossed the species barriers to infect humans, causing thousands of infections and hundreds of deaths, respectively. Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has become the cause of the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was discovered. Until 18 February 2020, there were 72 533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10 644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading among the public and causing substantial burden due to its human-to-human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic. In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that, other than pangolins and snakes, as previously suggested, turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii, Chelonia mydas, and Pelodiscus sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.",作者关键词:angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); receptor-binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S),文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25726,Composition and divergence of coronavirus spike proteins and host ACE2 receptors predict potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2,"作者:Liu, ZX (Liu, Zhixin)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Xiao, X (Xiao, Xiao)[ 1 ] ; Wei, XL (Wei, Xiuli)[ 1 ] ; Li, J (Li, Jian)[ 1 ] ; Yang, J (Yang, Jing)[ 1 ] ; Tan, HB (Tan, Huabing)[ 1 ] ; Zhu, JY (Zhu, Jianyong)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, QW (Zhang, Qiwei)[ 4,5 ] ; Wu, JG (Wu, Jianguo)[ 2,3,4 ] ; Liu, L (Liu, Long)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: JUN 2020,"Hubei Univ Med, Renmin Hosp, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Resp,Dept Infect Dis, Shiyan 442000, Peoples R China.

"摘要
To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed. To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we reanalyzed virome data sets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 and 1.19 to 1.31 x 10(-3) substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif.

"摘要
2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has attracted the world's attention over the last month. The Chinese government has taken emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps in the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19). However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as transmissibility and still holds many mysteries that are yet to be solved, such as whether the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients or by mothers to their infants. Our research presents selected available cases of COVID-19 in China to better understand the transmission and diagnosis regarding this infectious disease.",作者关键词:COVID-19; diagnosis; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; transmission,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25749,The transmission and diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19): A Chinese perspective,"作者:Han, Y (Han, Yu)[ 1 ] ; Yang, HL (Yang, Hailan)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Virology,,出版年: JUN 2020,"Shanxi Med Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Obstet, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we simulated the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number (R), and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.",作者关键词:basic reproductive number; COVID-19; data fitting; data simulation; effective reproductive number; effectiveness; intervention; SARS-CoV-2; SEIR; sensitivity analysis; transmission,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25750,Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and effectiveness of government interventions: A data-driven analysis,"作者:Fang, YQ (Fang, Yaqing)[ 1 ] ; Nie, YT (Nie, Yiting)[ 2 ] ; Penny, M (Penny, Marshare)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Virology,,出版年: JUN 2020,"Hangzhou Med Coll, Sch Publ Hlth, Hangzhou 310053, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging disease with fatal outcomes. In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.

Methods The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoVs.

Results SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoV.

Conclusion Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs.",作者关键词:codon bias; COVID-19; MERS CoV; nonstructural protein; preferred codons; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25754,From SARS and MERS CoVs to SARS-CoV-2: Moving toward more biased codon usage in viral structural and nonstructural genes,"作者:Kandeel, M (Kandeel, Mahmoud)[ 1,2 ] ; Ibrahim, A (Ibrahim, Abdelazim)[ 3,4 ] ; Fayez, M (Fayez, Mahmoud)[ 5,6 ] ; Al-Nazawi, M (Al-Nazawi, Mohammed)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,"Deanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Research Groups Track9 ",出版年: JUN 2020,"King Faisal Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Al Hufuf 31982, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.

"摘要
Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has been applied in many fields. However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a pattern on the corresponding Nettree, which reduces the time complexity. This paper also proposes three kinds of pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining. These pruning strategies are able to find the redundant patterns effectively since the strategies can predict the frequency and closeness of the patterns before the generation of the candidate patterns. Experimental results show that NetNCSP is not only more efficient but can also discover more closed patterns with good compressibility. Furtherly, in biological experiments NetNCSP mines the closed patterns in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses. The results show that the two viruses are of similar pattern composition with different combinations. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"摘要
In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus elucidated as the aetiologic agent. Although most initial cases occurred in China, the disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019, has become a pandemic and continues to spread rapidly with human-to-human transmission in many countries. This is the third novel coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades and presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources. A study of the initial Chinese response has shown that there is a significant positive association between coronavirus disease 2019 mortality and healthcare resource burden. Based on the Chinese experience, some 19% of coronavirus disease 2019 cases develop severe or critical disease. This results in a need for adequate preparation and mobilisation of critical care resources to anticipate and adapt to a surge in coronavirus disease 2019 case-load in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality. In this article, we discuss some of the peri-operative and critical care resource planning considerations and management strategies employed in a tertiary academic medical centre in Singapore in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.",作者关键词:COVID-19; critical care; healthcare; peri-operative; resource management,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15074,Battling COVID-19: critical care and peri-operative healthcare resource management strategies in a tertiary academic medical centre in Singapore,"作者:Lee, CCM (Lee, C.

Background The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a plethora of guidance and opinion from surgical societies. A controversial area concerns the safety of surgically created smoke and the perceived potential higher risk in laparoscopic surgery.

Methods The limited published evidence was analysed in combination with expert opinion. A review was undertaken of the novel coronavirus with regards to its hazards within surgical smoke and the procedures that could mitigate the potential risks to healthcare staff.

Results Using existing knowledge of surgical smoke, a theoretical risk of virus transmission exists. Best practice should consider the operating room set-up, patient movement and operating theatre equipment when producing a COVID-19 operating protocol. The choice of energy device can affect the smoke produced, and surgeons should manage the pneumoperitoneum meticulously during laparoscopic surgery. Devices to remove surgical smoke, including extractors, filters and non-filter devices, are discussed in detail.

Conclusion There is not enough evidence to quantify the risks of COVID-19 transmission in surgical smoke. However, steps can be undertaken to manage the potential hazards.

"摘要
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reorganization of healthcare settings affecting the delivery of clinical care to patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). There is a concern that patients with SMA may be at increased risk of manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19. Currently approved therapies for SMA improve survival and motor function; however, their delivery requires an increased exposure to the health system and a dedicated healthcare team. In this study, we discuss consensus recommendations pertaining to care of SMA patients during the pandemic. We highlight that SMA treatments should not be perceived as elective. Decisions regarding the delay of treatments should be made with consideration of the potential risks of COVID-19 exposure and the risk of that delay. We emphasize the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and healthcare provider, considering any geographic- or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.",作者关键词:corona; epidemic; guidelines; pandemic; SMA; treatment,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MUSCLE & NERVE,10.1002/mus.26903,Spinal muscular atrophy care in the COVID-19 pandemic era,"作者:Veerapandiyan, A (Veerapandiyan, Aravindhan)[ 1 ] ; Connolly, AM (Connolly, Anne M.)[ 2 ] ; Finkel, RS (Finkel, Richard S.)[ 3 ] ; Arya, K (Arya, Kapil)[ 1 ] ; Mathews, KD (Mathews, Katherine D.)[ 4 ] ; Smith, EC (Smith, Edward C.)[ 5 ] ; Castro, D (Castro, Diana)[ 6 ] ; Butterfield, RJ (Butterfield, Russell J.)[ 7 ] ; Parsons, JA (Parsons, Julie A.)[ 8 ] ; Servais, L (Servais, Laurent)[ 9,10 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Neurosciences & Neurology,,MAY 2020,"Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, 601 Elmwood Ave,POB 673, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.

"摘要
The outbreak of the new coronavirus infections COVID-19 in December 2019 in China has quickly become a global health emergency. Given the lack of specific anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease. COVID-19 pandemic is certainly conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is increased compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune system typical of autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the management of COVID-19. In this review we will critically analyse the evidences on either positive or negative effect of drugs commonly used to treat RA in this particular scenario, in order to optimize the current approach to RA patients.",作者关键词:Rheumatoid arthritis; COVID-19; Treatment; DMARDs; Cytokine release syndrome; Coronavirus,文献类型:Review,AUTOIMMUNITY REVIEWS,102523,"COVID-19 infection and rheumatoid arthritis: Faraway, so close!","作者:Favalli, EG (Favalli, Ennio Giulio)[ 1 ] ; Ingegnoli, F (Ingegnoli, Francesca)[ 1,2 ] ; De Lucia, O (De Lucia, Orazio)[ 1 ] ; Cincinelli, G (Cincinelli, Gilberto)[ 2 ] ; Cimaz, R (Cimaz, Rolando)[ 2,3 ] ; Caporali, R (Caporali, Roberto)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Immunology,,出版年: MAY 2020,"ASST Gaetano Pini, Div Clin Rheumatol, CTO Inst, Via Gaetano Pini 9, I-20122 Milan, Italy.

Background Little is known about the perinatal aspects of COVID-19. Objective To summarize available evidence and provide perinatologists/neonatologists with tools for managing their patients. Methods Analysis of available literature on COVID-19 using Medline and Google scholar. Results From scant data: vertical transmission from maternal infection during the third trimester probably does not occur or likely it occurs very rarely. Consequences of COVID-19 infection among women during early pregnancy remain unknown. We cannot conclude if pregnancy is a risk factor for more severe disease in women with COVID-19. Little is known about disease severity in neonates, and from very few samples, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been documented in human milk.

"摘要
Objectives There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronavirus during pregnancy. In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appears higher in those affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid review to guide health policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy.

Methods Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy. Data were extracted from relevant papers. This review has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were lacking.

Results From 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 21 relevant studies, all of which were case reports or case series, were identified. From reports of 32 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven (22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No maternal deaths have been reported to date. Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) delivered preterm. There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death. In 25 babies, no cases of vertical transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after delivery. Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively. SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester.

Conclusions Serious morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition. Preterm delivery affected 47% of women hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK's reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized. Based on this review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies. We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Under certain circumstances, such as during the current COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women can be a target for respiratory infection, and lung examination may be required as part of their clinical evaluation, ideally while avoiding exposure to radiation. We propose a practical approach for obstetricians/gynecologists to perform lung ultrasound examination, discussing potential applications, semiology and practical aspects, which could be of particular importance in emergency situations, such as the current pandemic infection of COVID-19.

"摘要
The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2. It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Wuhan city; Pneumonia; Pathogenesis,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY,102433,The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak,"作者:Rothan, HA (Rothan, Hussin A.)[ 1 ] ; Byrareddy, SN (Byrareddy, Siddappa N.)[ 2,3,4 ]",研究方向:Immunology,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

"摘要
The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV; Epidemiology; Pneumonia; Flu; Bats; Human to human transmission; Epidemic; Pandemic; Pyroptosis,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY,102434,The deadly coronaviruses: The 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2020 novel coronavirus epidemic in China,"作者:Yang, YS (Yang, Yongshi)[ 1 ] ; Peng, FJ (Peng, Fujun)[ 2,3 ] ; Wang, RS (Wang, Runsheng)[ 4,5 ] ; Guan, K (Guan, Kai)[ 1 ] ; Jiang, TJ (Jiang, Taijiao)[ 2,3 ] ; Xu, GG (Xu, Guogang)[ 5,6 ] ; Sun, JY (Sun, Jinlyu)[ 1 ] ; Chang, ROE (Chang, Christopher)[ 7,8 ]",研究方向:Immunology,Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation General Program ,出版年: MAY 2020,"Univ Calif Davis, 451 Hlth Sci Dr,Suite 6510, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

Recently, some global cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia have been caused by second- or third-generation transmission of the viral infection, resulting in no traceable epidemiological history. Owing to the complications of COVID-19 pneumonia, the first symptom and imaging features of patients can be very atypical and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections remains a challenge. It would aid radiologists and clinicians to be aware of the early atypical symptom and imaging features of the disease and contribute to the prevention of infected patients being missed.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Hemoptysis; Atypical symptoms; Atypical imaging features; 2019 novel coronavirus,文献类型:Editorial Material,KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.3348/kjr.2020.0181,2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia with Hemoptysis as the Initial Symptom: CT and Clinical Features,"作者:Shi, FX (Shi, Fengxia)[ 1 ] ; Yu, QB (Yu, Quanbo)[ 3 ] ; Huang, W (Huang, Wei)[ 4 ] ; Tan, CC (Tan, Chaochao)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Project of Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department ,出版年: MAY 2020,"Hunan Normal Univ, Dept Clin Lab, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hunan Prov Peoples Hosp, 61 JieFangXi Rd, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is a recent outbreak in mainland China and has rapidly spread to multiple countries worldwide. Pulmonary parenchymal opacities are often observed during chest radiography. Currently, few cases have reported the complications of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a case where serial follow-up chest computed tomography revealed progression of pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with lower lung predominance, thereby confirming COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, complications such as mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax were also observed during the course of the disease.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Coronavirus; Pneumonia; Complication; Tomography; X-ray computed,文献类型:Editorial Material,KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.3348/kjr.2020.0180,"Mediastinal Emphysema, Giant Bulla, and Pneumothorax Developed during the Course of COVID-19 Pneumonia","作者:Sun, RH (Sun, Ruihong)[ 1 ] ; Liu, HY (Liu, Hongyuan)[ 2 ] ; Wang, X (Wang, Xiang)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: MAY 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Radiol, Cent Hosp Wuhan, Tongji Med Coll, Shengli St 26, Wuhan 430014, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019 led to large numbers of people being infected and developing atypical pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). Typical imaging manifestations of patients infected with 2019-nCoV has been reported, but we encountered an atypical radiological manifestation on baseline computed tomography (CT) images in three patients from Wuhan, China infected with the 2019-nCoV. Surprisingly, the only similar CT finding was a solitary sub-centimeter ground-glass nodule adjacent to bronchovascular bundles, which could be easily overlooked. In addition, the follow-up images in these patients showed how COVID-19 pneumonia evolved from these small nodules. The radiologic manifestation of the three cases will expand contemporary understanding of COVID-19.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Solitary pulmonary nodule; Ground-glass; Pneumonia; viral; Tomography; X-ray computed,文献类型:Editorial Material,KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.3348/kjr.2020.0240,Small Solitary Ground-Glass Nodule on CT as an Initial Manifestation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia,"作者:Xia, TY (Xia, Tianyi)[ 1 ] ; Li, JW (Li, Jiawei)[ 2 ] ; Gao, J (Gao, Jiao)[ 2 ] ; Xu, XH (Xu, Xunhua)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: MAY 2020,"China Resources & WISCO Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, 209 Yejin Rd, Wuhan 430080, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Aims: A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19). Until today > 2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for > 8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

Materials and methods: In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin.

Key findings: The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease.

Significance: The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs. Besides, the study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly emerged viral infection.",作者关键词:Wuhan coronavirus; COVID-19; RdRp; Docking; Structural bioinformatics; Sofosbuvir; Nucleotide inhibitors,文献类型:Article,LIFE SCIENCES,117477,"Anti-HCV, nucleotide inhibitors, repurposing against COVID-19","作者:Elfiky, AA (Elfiky, Abdo A.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,出版年: MAY 1 2020,"Cairo Univ, Fac Sci, Biophys Dept, Giza, Egypt.

Introduction This statement was planned on 11 March 2020 to provide clinical guidance and aid staff preparation for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia and New Zealand. It has been widely endorsed by relevant specialty colleges and societies.

Main recommendations

Generic guidelines exist for the intubation of different patient groups, as do resources to facilitate airway rescue and transition to the ""can't intubate, can't oxygenate"" scenario. They should be followed where they do not contradict our specific recommendations for the COVID-19 patient group.

Consideration should be given to using a checklist that has been specifically modified for the COVID-19 patient group.

Early intubation should be considered to prevent the additional risk to staff of emergency intubation and to avoid prolonged use of high flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation.

Significant institutional preparation is required to optimise staff and patient safety in preparing for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group.

The principles for airway management should be the same for all patients with COVID-19 (asymptomatic, mild or critically unwell).

Safe, simple, familiar, reliable and robust practices should be adopted for all episodes of airway management for patients with COVID-19.

Changes in management as a result of this statement Airway clinicians in Australia and New Zealand should now already be involved in regular intensive training for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group. This training should focus on the principles of early intervention, meticulous planning, vigilant infection control, efficient processes, clear communication and standardised practice.",作者关键词:Infectious diseases; Intensive care; Pneumonia; viral; Respiratory tract infections; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA,10.5694/mja2.50598,Consensus statement: Safe Airway Society principles of airway management and tracheal intubation specific to the COVID-19 adult patient group,"作者:Brewster, DJ (Brewster, David J.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Chrimes, N (Chrimes, Nicholas)[ 3 ] ; Do, TB (Do, Thy B.

"摘要
Objectives: The aim of the present study was to prevent cross-infection in the operating room during emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by following anesthesia management protocols, and to document clinical- and anesthesia-related characteristics of these patients.

Design: This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study.

Setting: This study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China.

Participants: Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China.

Interventions: Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan.

Measurements and Main Results: Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scanning.

Conclusions: The present study indicates that COVID 19-specific guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room. Most patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography scans.

"摘要
OBJECTIVE. The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease).

RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.

CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.",作者关键词:coronavirus disease; COVID-19; CT; pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY,10.2214/AJR.20.22976,Relation Between Chest CT Findings and Clinical Conditions of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Multicenter Study,"作者:Zhao, W (Zhao, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Zhong, Z (Zhong, Zheng)[ 2,3 ] ; Xie, XZ (Xie, Xingzhi)[ 1 ] ; Yu, QZ (Yu, Qizhi)[ 2,3 ] ; Liu, J (Liu, Jun)[ 1,4 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Key Emergency Project of Pneumonia Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Infection in Hunan Province ,出版年: MAY 2020,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Radiol, 139 Middle Remin Rd, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China.

OBJECTIVE. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pulmonary illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, more than 79,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide. The virus is rapidly spreading with human-to-human transmission despite imposed precautions. Because similar pulmonary syndromes have been reported from other strains of the coronavirus family, our aim is to review the lessons from imaging studies obtained during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks.

CONCLUSION. The review of experiences with the MERS and SARS outbreaks will help us better understand the role of the radiologist in combating the outbreak of COVID-19. The known imaging manifestations of the novel coronavirus and the possible unknowns will also be discussed.",作者关键词:chest; coronavirus; COVID-19; CT scan; outbreak; pneumonia; radiography,文献类型:Review,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY,10.2214/AJR.20.22969,Radiology Perspective of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Lessons From Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"作者:Hosseiny, M (Hosseiny, Melina)[ 1 ] ; Kooraki, S (Kooraki, Soheil)[ 2 ] ; Gholamrezanezhad, A (Gholamrezanezhad, Ali)[ 2,3 ] ; Reddy, S (Reddy, Sravanthi)[ 2 ] ; Myers, L (Myers, Lee)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: MAY 2020,"Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Radiol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.

"摘要
Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2], COVID-2019 [coronavirus disease 2019], or 2019-nCoV [2019 novel coronavirus]) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in nonhuman animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFN-beta) was shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-IFN-beta also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-IFN-beta against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mouse model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have suggested that proinflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aims to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that have shown potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; antiviral agents; coronavirus,文献类型:Review,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,e00399-20,Compounds with Therapeutic Potential against Novel Respiratory 2019 Coronavirus,"作者:Martinez, MA (Angel Martinez, Miguel)",研究方向:Microbiology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Spanish Government,出版年: MAY 2020,

"摘要
In this note we analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window 22/01 - 15/03/2020. A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 260 00 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"摘要
Objectives: Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.

Methods: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike.

Results: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain beta (SBD beta). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBD beta of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.

Conclusions: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.

"摘要
Background: Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020.

Results: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.

Conclusions: The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.

"摘要
Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning. We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported.

Methods: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared.

Findings: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed (n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (P = 0.007, P < 0.001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P = 0.001, P < 0.001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6-9 days after initial CT scans.

Interpretation: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

"摘要
Objectives: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.

Methods: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020.

Results: All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 x10(9) cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 x10(9) cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.

Conclusions: Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them.

"摘要
Background: Since December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has impacted nearly >90,000 people in more than 75 countries. In this case report, we aim to define the chest computed tomography findings of 2019-novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia and its successful resolution after treatment.

Case Report: A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of ""fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia."" Initially, she was given Tamiflu. The influenza A virus serology was negative. Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient's symptoms did not improve. The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip. Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2 degrees C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive.

"摘要
Purpose: We aimed to compare chest HRCT lung signs identified in scans of differently aged patients with COVID-19 infections.

Methods: Case data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province in China were collected, and chest HRCT signs of infected patients in four age groups ( < 18 years, 18-44 years, 45-59 years, >= 60 years) were compared.

Results: Small patchy, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidations were the main HRCT signs in 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. Patients aged 45-59 years and aged >= 60 years had more bilateral lung, lung lobe, and lung field involvement, and greater lesion numbers than patients < 18 years. GGO accompanied with the interlobular septa thickening or a crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and air bronchogram sign were more common in patients aged 45-59 years, and >= 60 years, than in those aged < 18 years, and aged 18-44 years.

Conclusions: Chest HRCT manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are related to patient's age, and HRCT signs may be milder in younger patients.",作者关键词:COVID-19; High-resolution computed tomography; Ground-glass opacity; Pure ground-glass opacity,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,108972,High-resolution computed tomography manifestations of COVID-19 infections in patients of different ages,"作者:Chen, ZH (Chen, Zuhua)[ 1 ] ; Fan, HJ (Fan, Hongjie)[ 2 ] ; Cai, J (Cai, Jian)[ 3 ] ; Li, YJ (Li, Yunjiang)[ 1 ] ; Wu, BL (Wu, Baoliang)[ 1 ] ; Hou, YC (Hou, Yanchun)[ 1 ] ; Xu, SF (Xu, Shufeng)[ 2 ] ; Zhou, F (Zhou, Fei)[ 2 ] ; Liu, YG (Liu, Yongguang)[ 1 ] ; Xuan, WL (Xuan, Weiling)[ 1 ] ...更多内容","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Zhejiang University special scientific research fund for COVID-19 prevention and control ,出版年: MAY 2020,"Zhejiang Univ, Sir Run Run Shaw Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, 3 East Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Purpose: To report CT features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients with various disease severity.

Methods: The CT manifestations and clinical data of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia.

Results: Six patients (8%) were diagnosed as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or manifested mild changes of lung infection. All 43 patients (59 %) with common type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening. In the 21 patients (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively. An extensive ""white lung"", with atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in critical type patients (3, 4%). On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities.

Conclusions: Different CT features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19 stratification.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease-2019; Pneumonia; Computer tomography; X-ray; Diagnosis,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,108941,CT manifestations of coronavirus disease-2019: A retrospective analysis of 73 cases by disease severity,"作者:Liu, KC (Liu, Kai-Cai)[ 1 ] ; Xu, P (Xu, Ping)[ 2 ] ; Lv, WF (Lv, Wei-Fu)[ 3 ] ; Qiu, XH (Qiu, Xiao-Hui)[ 4 ] ; Yao, JL (Yao, Jin-Long)[ 5 ] ; Gu, JF (Gu, Jin-Feng)[ 6 ] ; Wei, W (Wei, Wei)[ 3 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,出版年: MAY 2020,"Anhui Med Univ, Hefei Hosp, Hefei Peoples Hosp 2, Dept Resp, 1 Guangde Rd, Hefei 230011, Anhui, Peoples R China.

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods: This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion, who were examined by both CT and rRT-PCR at initial presentation. The sensitivities of both tests were then compared. For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated.

Results: A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT. Using rRT-PCR, 30 patients were tested positive, with 6 cases initially missed. Amongst these 6 patients, 3 became positive in the second rRT-PCR assay(after 2 days, 2 days and 3 days respectively), and the other 3 became positive only in the third round of rRT-PCR tests(after 5 days, 6 days and 8 days respectively). At presentation, CT sensitivity was therefore 97.2%, whereas the sensitivity of initial rRT-PCR was only 83.3%.

Conclusion: rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.",作者关键词:Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Coronavirus; Pneumonia; Tomography; X-Ray Computed,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,108961,Diagnosis of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): rRT-PCR or CT?,"作者:Long, CQ (Long, Chunqin)[ 2 ] ; Xu, HX (Xu, Huaxiang)[ 3 ] ; Shen, QL (Shen, Qinglin)[ 4 ] ; Zhang, XH (Zhang, Xianghai)[ 2 ] ; Fan, B (Fan, Bing)[ 1 ] ; Wang, CH (Wang, Chuanhong)[ 1 ] ; Zeng, BL (Zeng, Bingliang)[ 1 ] ; Li, ZC (Li, Zicong)[ 1 ] ; Li, XF (Li, Xiaofen)[ 1 ] ; Li, HL (Li, Honglu)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: MAY 2020,"Jiangxi Prov Peoples Hosp, Radiol Dept, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.

Purpose To discuss the different characteristics of clinical, laboratory, and chest computed tomography (CT) in pediatric patients from adults with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

Methods The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital.

Results Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%).

Conclusion Procalcitonin elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric patients which were different from adults. It is suggested that underlying coinfection may be more common in pediatrics, and the consolidation with surrounding halo sign which is considered as a typical sign in pediatric patients.",作者关键词:child; clinical features; COVID-19; infection; tomography,文献类型:Article,PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY,10.1002/ppul.24718,Clinical and CT features in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection: Different points from adults,"作者:Xia, W (Xia, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Shao, JB (Shao, Jianbo)[ 1 ] ; Guo, Y (Guo, Yu)[ 1 ] ; Peng, XH (Peng, Xuehua)[ 1 ] ; Li, Z (Li, Zhen)[ 2 ] ; Hu, DY (Hu, Daoyu)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics; Respiratory System,,出版年: MAY 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan Maternal & Child Healthcare Hosp, Dept Imaging Ctr,Wuhan Childrens Hosp, Wuhan 430015, Hubei, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The Issue: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives. Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. Recommendations: The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.",作者关键词:COVID-19; virus; pandemic; trauma; PTSD,文献类型:Article,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,10.1037/tra0000592,Traumatic Stress in the Age of COVID-19: A Call to Close Critical Gaps and Adapt to New Realities,"作者:Horesh, D (Horesh, Danny)[ 1,2 ] ; Brown, AD (Brown, Adam D.)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Psychology; Psychiatry,,出版年: MAY 2020,"Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Psychol, Bldg 902,Room 313, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.

"摘要
AIM: To report the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Xiaogan, Hubei, China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients.

RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers (p<0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively.

CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.

"摘要
As an aerosol and droplets generating procedure, tracheostomy increases contamination risks for health workers in the coronavirus disease context. To preserve the health care system capacity and to limit virus cross-transmission, protecting caregivers against coronavirus infection is of critical importance. We report the use of external fixator equipment to set up a physical interface between the patient's neck and the caregiver performing a tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. Once the metal frame set in place, it is wrapped with a single-use clear and sterile cover for surgical C-arm. This installation is simple, easy, and fast to achieve and can be carried out with inexpensive material available in every hospital. This physical interface is an additional safety measure that prevents the direct projection of secretions or droplets. It should, of course, only be considered as a complement to strict compliance with barrier precautions and personal protective equipment.",作者关键词:caregivers; COVID-19; safety; tracheostomy; transmission,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26222,Health workers' safety during tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients: Homemade protective screen,"作者:Cordier, PY (Cordier, Pierre-Yves)[ 1 ] ; De La Villeon, B (De La Villeon, Bruno)[ 2 ] ; Martin, E (Martin, Edouard)[ 1 ] ; Goudard, Y (Goudard, Yvain)[ 2 ] ; Haen, P (Haen, Pierre)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Laveran Mil Teaching Hosp, Intens Care Unit, 34 Blvd Laveran, F-13384 Marseille, France.

We report acute antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 285 patients with COVID-19. Within 19 days after symptom onset, 100% of patients tested positive for antiviral immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Seroconversion for IgG and IgM occurred simultaneously or sequentially. Both IgG and IgM titers plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion. Serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic infections.

A cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a longitudinal follow-up study of patients with COVID-19 suggest that SARS-CoV2-specific IgG or IgM seroconversion occurs within 20 days post symptom onset.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE MEDICINE,10.1038/s41591-020-0897-1,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19,"作者:Long, QX (Long, Quan-Xin)[ 1 ] ; Liu, BZ (Liu, Bai-Zhong)[ 2 ] ; Deng, HJ (Deng, Hai-Jun)[ 1 ] ; Wu, GC (Wu, Gui-Cheng)[ 3,4 ] ; Deng, K (Deng, Kun)[ 5 ] ; Chen, YK (Chen, Yao-Kai)[ 6 ] ; Liao, P (Liao, Pu)[ 7 ] ; Qiu, JF (Qiu, Jing-Fu)[ 8 ] ; Lin, Y (Lin, Yong)[ 1 ] ; Cai, XF (Cai, Xue-Fei)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Emergency Project from the Science & Technology Commission of Chongqing ,APR 2020,"Chongqing Med Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mol Biol Infect Dis, Chongqing, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Personal protective equipment has become an important and emotive subject during the current coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately 1 metre from the patient. Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevant during airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from coronavirus disease 2019 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care - contact, droplet or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not. Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol generating procedures. Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipment including use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.",作者关键词:airborne; contact; coronavirus; COVID-19; droplet; personal protective equipment,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15071,Personal protective equipment during the coronavirus disease (COVID) 2019 pandemic - a narrative review,"作者:Cook, TM (Cook, T.

"摘要
Ultrasound imaging of the lung and associated tissues may play an important role in the management of patients with COVID-19-associated lung injury. Compared with other monitoring modalities, such as auscultation or radiographic imaging, we argue lung ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy, is ergonomically favourable and has fewer infection control implications. By informing the initiation, escalation, titration and weaning of respiratory support, lung ultrasound can be integrated into COVID-19 care pathways for patients with respiratory failure. Given the unprecedented pressure on healthcare services currently, supporting and educating clinicians is a key enabler of the wider implementation of lung ultrasound. This narrative review provides a summary of evidence and clinical guidance for the use and interpretation of lung ultrasound for patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19-associated lung injury. Mechanisms by which the potential lung ultrasound workforce can be deployed are explored, including a pragmatic approach to training, governance, imaging, interpretation of images and implementation of lung ultrasound into routine clinical practice.",作者关键词:COVID-19; lung ultrasound; point-of-care ultrasound; training; workforce,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15082,Point-of-care lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19-a narrative review,"作者:Smith, MJ (Smith, M.

Background In the context of COVID-19, cancer survivors represent a particularly vulnerable population that may be ""doubly hit"" by both costs of cancer treatment and financial strain imposed by the pandemic.

Methods We performed a review of the literature pertaining to cancer, financial toxicity, and economic challenges.

Results Multiple societies have put forth recommendations to modify delivery of cancer care in order to minimize patient exposure to the virus. Cancer survivors, especially patients with head and neck cancer, have been disproportionately affected by rising unemployment levels and economic recessions in the past, both of which are linked to higher cancer mortality. Patients who rely on employer-provided insurance and do not qualify for Medicaid may lose access to life-saving treatments.

Background The coronavirus infection is rapidly spreading, putting a strain on health care services across the globe. Patients with oral cancer are susceptible often immunosuppressed due to the disease and/or the treatment received.

Methods We performed a simulation of the currently available data using a multistate and hazards model to provide an objective model for counseling and decision making for health care workers.

Results Stage IV patients with oral cancer who did not receive treatment had progression of disease and an increased mortality rate compared to patients who receive treatment but did not contract COVID-19. The patients who received treatment and got affected with COVID-19 had a far worse impact and higher mortality rate than all other groups.

Conclusion Isolation and deferring treatment for stage IV patients with oral cancer, so as to avoid hospital visits and contraction of COVID-19, is an advisable strategy based on this model.",作者关键词:cancer; coronavirus; COVID-19; simulation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26196,Should we wait or not?

Background The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused rapid changes in head and neck cancer (HNC) care. ""Real-time"" methods to monitor practice patterns can optimize provider safety and patient care.

Methods Head and neck surgeons from 14 institutions in the United States regularly contributed their practice patterns to a shared spreadsheet. Data from 27 March 2020 to 5 April 2020 was analyzed.

Results All institutions had significantly restricted HNC clinic evaluations. Two institutions stopped free-flap surgery with the remaining scheduling surgery by committee review. Factors contributing to reduced clinical volume included lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) (35%) and lack of rapid COVID-19 testing (86%).

Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in HNC care. Rapid COVID-19 testing and correlation with infectious potential remain paramount to resuming the care of patients with head and neck cancer.

The COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in many hospitals and practices to cancel in-person outpatient clinic visits, where head and neck patients receive their critical longitudinal care. Out of necessity, most practices have been encouraged to use telemedicine as a method to maintain a continuum of care with their patients. As a result, the prevalence of telemedicine has grown rapidly during this pandemic, without allowing the physicians and patients to be adequately educated on how best to utilize the services. There is a steep learning curve as we have learned, and our goal is to provide guidelines for both patients and physicians, as well as a valuable patient handout in preparation for their visit.",作者关键词:cancer; COVID-19; patient care; telehealth; telemedicine,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26197,Optimizing your telemedicine visit during the COVID-19 pandemic: Practice guidelines for patients with head and neck cancer,"作者:Prasad, A (Prasad, Aman)[ 1 ] ; Brewster, R (Brewster, Ryan)[ 2 ] ; Newman, JG (Newman, Jason G.)[ 1 ] ; Rajasekaran, K (Rajasekaran, Karthik)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 800 Walnut St,18th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.

"摘要
Elderly patients with head and neck cancer are at increased risk of adverse outcomes during and after treatment of head and neck cancer. COVID-19 severity and mortality can be expected to be significantly greater in elderly patients with head and neck cancer, given that increased age, comorbidities, and presence of malignancy are known risk factors for disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, their management requires multidisciplinary consensus and patient input. A thorough geriatric assessment, which has been shown to be beneficial prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, could be particularly helpful in this patient population with the added dimension of COVID-19 risk. In many cases, prudent treatment plan modification may allow for overall best outcomes. Furthermore, recruitment of social services and, when appropriate, palliative care, may allow for optimal management of these patients.",作者关键词:COVID-19; geriatrics; head and neck cancer; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26216,Special considerations for elderly patients with head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Sharma, A (Sharma, Arun)[ 1 ] ; Crosby, DL (Crosby, Dana L.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 720 N Bond St, Springfield, IL 62794 USA.

The impact of these changes parallels other fields in oncology, but is disproportionate due to protective measures and limitations on potentially aerosolizing procedures and related interventions specific to the upper aerodigestive tract.

"摘要
With multiple virus epicenters, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Consequently, many countries have implemented different policies to manage this crisis including curfew and lockdown. However, the efficacy of individual policies remains unclear with respect to COVID-19 case development. We analyzed available data on COVID-19 cases of eight majorly affected countries, including China, Italy, Iran, Germany, France, Spain, South Korea, and Japan. Growth rates and doubling time of cases were calculated for the first 6 weeks after the initial cases were declared for each respective country and put into context with implemented policies. Although the growth rate of total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China has decreased, those for Japan have remained constant. For European countries, the growth rate of COVID-19 cases considerably increased during the second time interval. Interestingly, the rates for Germany, Spain, and France are the highest measured in the second interval and even surpass the numbers in Italy. Although the initial data in Asian countries are encouraging with respect to case development at the initial stage, the opposite is true for European countries. Based on our data, disease management in the 2 weeks following the first reported cases is of utmost importance.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; effective; measures; pandemic; spread,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25883,Failure in initial stage containment of global COVID-19 epicenters,"作者:Khosrawipour, V (Khosrawipour, Veria)[ 1,2 ] ; Lau, H (Lau, Hien)[ 1 ] ; Khosrawipour, T (Khosrawipour, Tanja)[ 1,3 ] ; Kocbach, P (Kocbach, Piotr)[ 4 ] ; Ichii, H (Ichii, Hirohito)[ 1 ] ; Bania, J (Bania, Jacek)[ 2 ] ; Mikolajczyk, A (Mikolajczyk, Agata)[ 5 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Gen Surg, 333 City Blvd West,Suite 850, Orange, CA 92868 USA.

"摘要
Several systematic reviews (SRs) have been conducted on the COVID-19 outbreak, which together with the SRs on previous coronavirus outbreaks, form important sources of evidence for clinical decision and policy making. Here, we investigated the methodological quality of SRs on COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Online searches were performed to obtain SRs on COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. The methodological quality of the included SRs was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. In total, of 49 SRs that were finally included in our study, 17, 16, and 16 SRs were specifically on COVID-19, MERS, and SARS, respectively. The growth rate of SRs on COVID-19 was the highest (4.54/month) presently. Of the included SRs, 6, 12, and 31 SRs were of moderate, low, and critically low quality, respectively. SRs on SARS showed the optimum quality among the SRs on the three diseases. Subgroup analyses showed that the SR topic (P < .001), the involvement of a methodologist (P < .001), and funding support (P = .046) were significantly associated with the methodological quality of the SR. According to the adherence scores, adherence to AMSTAR-2 items sequentially decreased in SRs on SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The methodological quality of most SRs on coronavirus outbreaks is unsatisfactory, and those on COVID-19 have higher risks of poor quality, despite the rapid actions taken to conduct SRs. The quality of SRs should be improved in the future. Readers must exercise caution in accepting and using the results of these SRs.",作者关键词:AMSTAR-2; COVID-19; evidence; methodological quality; systematic review,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25901,Assessment of the quality of systematic reviews on COVID-19: A comparative study of previous coronavirus outbreaks,"作者:Yu, Y (Yu, Yang)[ 1,2 ] ; Shi, QL (Shi, Qianling)[ 3,4 ] ; Zheng, P (Zheng, Peng)[ 1,2 ] ; Gao, L (Gao, Lei)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, HY (Li, Haiyuan)[ 1,2 ] ; Tao, PX (Tao, Pengxian)[ 1,2 ] ; Gu, BH (Gu, Baohong)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, DF (Wang, Dengfeng)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, H (Chen, Hao)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,Talent Staff Fund of the Lanzhou University Second Hospital ,APR 2020,"Lanzhou Univ, Hosp 2, Dept Tumour Surg, 80 Cuiying Gate,Linxia Rd, Lanzhou 730030, Gansu, Peoples R China.

Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an ongoing global health emergency. The aim of our study was to investigate the changes of liver function and its clinical significance in COVID-19 patients.

Method This retrospective, single-centre study was conducted on 115 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University from 18 January 2020 to 22 February 2020. Liver function and related indexes were analysed to evaluate its relationship with disease progression in COVID-19 patients.

Results Part of the COVID-19 patients presented with varying degrees of abnormality in liver function indexes. However, the levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, GGT and LDH in COVID-19 patients were not significantly different when compared with hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia patients, and the levels of albumin is even significantly higher. The levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, LDH and INR showed statistically significant elevation in severe COVID-19 cases compared with that in mild cases. However, the clinical significance of the elevation is unremarkable. Majority of severe COVID-19 patients showed significantly decreasing in albumin level and continuously decreasing in the progress of illness. Most of the liver function indexes in COVID-19 patients were correlated with CRP and NLR, the markers of inflammation. Logistic regression analysis further identified NLR as the independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, as well as age.

Conclusions Although abnormalities of liver function indexes are common in COVID-19 patients, the impairment of liver function is not a prominent feature of COVID-19, and also may not have serious clinical consequences.",作者关键词:clinical significance; COVID-19; liver function; SARS-CoV-2; Wuhan,文献类型:Article; Early Access,LIVER INTERNATIONAL,10.1111/liv.14455,"Liver impairment in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective analysis of 115 cases from a single centre in Wuhan city, China","作者:Zhang, YF (Zhang, Yafei)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zheng, L (Zheng, Liang)[ 4 ] ; Liu, L (Liu, Lan)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhao, MY (Zhao, Mengya)[ 5 ] ; Xiao, J (Xiao, Jun)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhao, Q (Zhao, Qiu)[ 1,2,3 ]",研究方向:Gastroenterology & Hepatology,,APR 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Zhongnan Hosp, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

Background In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, computed tomography (CT) examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a large-scale study. Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. Purpose To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. Material and methods We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. Results We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. Conclusion The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Tomography; X-ray computed; Pneumonia; viral; Diagnosis; Pandemics; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00330-020-06863-0,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imaging reporting and data system (COVID-RADS) and common lexicon: a proposal based on the imaging data of 37 studies,"作者:Salehi, S (Salehi, Sana)[ 1 ] ; Abedi, A (Abedi, Aidin)[ 1 ] ; Balakrishnan, S (Balakrishnan, Sudheer)[ 1 ] ; Gholamrezanezhad, A (Gholamrezanezhad, Ali)[ 1,2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,APR 2020,"Univ Sothern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.

Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Taizhou, China. Methods A single center retrospective observational study was performed between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 11, 2020 at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Zhejiang, China. All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records. Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared. Results Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was 47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%). Common symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue (40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%). According to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no abnormal result. Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03). Of the 43 severely ill patients, 6 (14%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 1 (2.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Conclusions Older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition.

"摘要
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, a global pandemic. In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n=30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 +/- 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 +/- 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 +/- 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n=50 states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 +/- 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 +/- 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemiology modeling; SEIR model; Network model,文献类型:Article; Early Access,BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s10237-020-01332-5,Outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States,"作者:Peirlinck, M (Peirlinck, Mathias)[ 1,2 ] ; Linka, K (Linka, Kevin)[ 1,2 ] ; Costabal, FS (Sahli Costabal, Francisco)[ 3,4,5 ] ; Kuhl, E (Kuhl, Ellen)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Biophysics; Engineering,Stanford Bio-X IIP seed grant ,APR 2020,"Stanford Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in new challenges for clinicians, head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and carers. There is evidence that the current crisis is affecting the management of HNC patients. Most healthcare systems have introduced remote consultations to decrease the risk of coronavirus infection to patients, carers and clinicians. At present, HNC patients may be anxious and due to logistical issues, may not be adequately prepared for their treatment. To ensure that patients have a thorough understanding of their treatment and expected outcome during the current COVID-19 crisis there may be merit in the use of the HaNC-AD PCI.",作者关键词:Patient concerns inventory; Head and neck cancer; SARS-CoV-2; Coronavirus,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY,10.1007/s00405-020-05995-9,The After Diagnosis Head and Neck cancer-specific Patient Concerns Inventory (HaNC-AD) as a pre-treatment preparation aid during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Kanatas, A (Kanatas, Anastasios)[ 1 ] ; Rogers, SN (Rogers, S.

Early classification of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is essential for disease cure and control. Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals' precious time. In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (-ve). Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images. Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Convolutional neural networks; Chest CT; Multi-objective; Differential evolution,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1007/s10096-020-03901-z,Classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images using multi-objective differential evolution-based convolutional neural networks,"作者:Singh, D (Singh, Dilbag)[ 1 ] ; Kumar, V (Kumar, Vijay)[ 2 ] ; Vaishali (Vaishali)[ 3 ] ; Kaur, M (Kaur, Manjit)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,,APR 2020,"Manipal Univ Jaipur, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Comp & Commun Engn Dept, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.

Aim To illustrate the [18F]FDG-PET/CT findings in patients affected by cancer with clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 Methods We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients who showed pulmonary involvement unrelated to cancer metastases on March 13 and 16 2020. We reviewed the scans, collected medical history, and exposure information. Results Among the 13 scans, we identified 5 cases with imaging findings suspicious for viral infection. Peripheral lung consolidations and/or ground-glass opacities in two or more lobes were found. Lung abnormalities displayed increased [18F]FDG uptake (SUVmax 4.3-11.3). All the patients on the day of PET/CT acquisition were asymptomatic, and they did not have fever or cough. In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated. At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms. Conclusions The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management. Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom. Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Coronavirus; FDG-PET; CT; Asymptomatic; Imaging,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING,10.1007/s00259-020-04819-6,FDG-PET/CT findings highly suspicious for COVID-19 in an Italian case series of asymptomatic patients,"作者:Setti, L (Setti, Lucia)[ 1 ] ; Kirienko, M (Kirienko, Margarita)[ 2 ] ; Dalto, SC (Dalto, Serena Camilla)[ 3 ] ; Bonacina, M (Bonacina, Manuela)[ 1 ] ; Bombardieri, E (Bombardieri, Emilio)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,APR 2020,"Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Nucl Med Unit, Via Venezian 1, I-20133 Milan, Italy.

Background During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, tracheostomy may be required for COVID-19 patients requiring long-term ventilation in addition to other conditions such as airway compromise from head and neck cancer. As an aerosol-generating procedure, tracheostomy increases the exposure of health care workers to COVID-19 infection. Performing surgical tracheostomy and tracheostomy care requires a strategy that mitigates these risks and maintains the quality of patient care.

Methods This study is a multidisciplinary review of institutional tracheostomy guidelines and clinical pathways. Modifications to support clinical decision making in the context of COVID-19 were derived by consensus and available evidence.

Results Modified guidelines for all phases of tracheostomy care at an academic tertiary care center in the setting of COVID-19 are presented.

Discussion During the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians must carefully consider the indications, procedural precautions, and postoperative care for tracheostomies. We present guidelines to mitigate risk to health care workers while preserving the quality of care.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; personal protective equipment (PPE); tracheostomy; tracheotomy,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26191,Tracheostomy guidelines developed at a large academic medical center during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:David, AP (David, Abel P.)[ 1 ] ; Russell, MD (Russell, Marika D.)[ 1 ] ; El-Sayed, IH (El-Sayed, Ivan H.)[ 1 ] ; Russell, MS (Russell, Matthew S.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 2233 Post St,3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.

Health crises have become a popular topic of discussion. In the wave of the ongoing pandemic, experts have suggested the role of vaping and other tobacco product use exemplifying the vulnerability of the population to contract the COVID-19. We discuss some of the events that led up to these conclusions and also offer a unique insight into another form of tobacco use that is potentially propagating its spread especially in the South Asian region-chewed tobacco. Both of these have been a perennial issue that head and neck cancer surgeons have been dealing with.

"摘要
The rapid spread of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present. Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.",作者关键词:Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; Angiotensin receptor blocker; Angiotensin II type-1 receptor; Acute lung injury; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,HYPERTENSION RESEARCH,10.1038/s41440-020-0455-8,"Interactions of coronaviruses with ACE2, angiotensin II, and RAS inhibitors-lessons from available evidence and insights into COVID-19","作者:Kai, H (Kai, Hisashi)[ 1 ] ; Kai, M (Kai, Mamiko)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)

"摘要
Background Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been announced as a new coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization. At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID.

Methods From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means clustering.

Results Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID. We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics.

Conclusion The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them. We suggest researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; intellectual disability; machine learning; text mining,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH,10.1111/jir.12730,Coronaviruses and people with intellectual disability: an exploratory data analysis,"作者:Tummers, J (Tummers, J.)[ 1,4 ] ; Catal, C (Catal, C.)[ 2 ] ; Tobi, H (Tobi, H.)[ 3 ] ; Tekinerdogan, B (Tekinerdogan, B.)[ 1 ] ; Leusink, G (Leusink, G.)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Education & Educational Research; Genetics & Heredity; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry; Rehabilitation,"Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport ",APR 2020,"Wageningen Univ & Res, Informat Technol Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.

Purpose The aim of this manuscript is to review the available strategies in the international literature to efficiently and safely return to both normal orthopaedic surgical activities and to normal outpatient clinical activities in the aftermath of a large epidemic or pandemic. This information would be beneficial to adequately reorganize outpatient clinics and hospitals to provide the highest possible level of orthopaedic care to our patients in a safe and efficient manner. Methods A literature search was performed for relevant research articles. In addition, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the EU CDC and other government health agency websites were searched for any relevant information. In particular, interest was paid to strategies and advise on managing the orthopaedic patient flow during outpatient clinics as well as surgical procedures including the necessary safety measures, while still providing a high-quality patient experience. The obtained information is provided as a narrative review. Results There was not any specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities and the particular challenges in dealing with a high-volume practice, in the afterwave of a pandemic. Conclusion As the COVID-19 crisis has abruptly halted most of the orthopaedic activities both in the outpatient clinic and the operating room, a progressive start-up scenario needs to be planned. The exact timing largely depends on factors outside of our control. After restrictions will be lifted, clinical and surgical volume will progressively increase. This paper offers key points and possible strategies to provide the highest level of safety to both the orthopaedic patient and the orthopaedic team including administrative staff and nurses, during the start-up phase.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID; Orthopaedic surgery; Outpatient clinic,文献类型:Article; Early Access,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY,10.1007/s00167-020-06031-3,Returning to orthopaedic business as usual after COVID-19: strategies and options,"作者:de Caro, F (de Caro, Francesca)[ 1 ] ; Hirschmann, TM (Hirschmann, Thomas Michael)[ 2,3,4 ] ; Verdonk, P (Verdonk, Peter)[ 5,6 ]",研究方向:Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Ist Cura Citta Pavia, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Via Parco Vecchio 27, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.

"摘要
Timely analysis of the laboratory characteristics associated with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) can assist with clinical diagnosis and prognosis. This study is a collection of clinical data from 54 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Zhongfa Xincheng district of China at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 28, 2020 to February 11, 2020. The average age of the patients was 61.8 +/- 14.5 years, and the predominant age group was 50-79. The proportion of critical-type patients with comorbidities was higher than that of severe-type patients. Lymphocyte counts were significantly reduced in routine bloodwork for all patients, but significantly lower in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. Prolongation of prothrombin times (PT) and elevation of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers (D-Ds) were detected in coagulation function tests, and more significant changes were observed in critical-type patients compared to severe-type patients. Serum ferritin levels were sensitive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but could not be used for disease assessment. In addition, levels of two inflammatory factors, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in all patients, but higher in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. Moreover, kidney injury was the second-most common organ affected by COVID-19 followed by heart and liver. Kidney and heart injury were more severe in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered. Of the critical-type patients, six died and 17 recovered. The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients. In summary, increased lymphocyte counts, prolonged PT, secondary increases in fibrinolytic activity and increases in sIL-2R and IL-6 are typical features of COVID-19 and are associated with disease severity.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,LABORATORY INVESTIGATION,10.1038/s41374-020-0431-6,Retrospective analysis of laboratory testing in 54 patients with severe- or critical-type 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,"作者:Li, YL (Li, Yanlei)[ 1 ] ; Hu, YB (Hu, Yanbing)[ 2 ] ; Yu, JY (Yu, Jinyan)[ 3 ] ; Ma, TG (Ma, Tiangang)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine; Pathology,,APR 2020,"Second Hosp Jilin Univ, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Changchun 130041, Jilin, Peoples R China.

Health care services are being confronted by a daily dilemma of who can receive critical care and who cannot. In a palliative care clinic, this apprehension gets exemplified, as these patients have limited life expectancy. The head and neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted. This document strives to define the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better patient care in a triage context. Practical steps suggested are protective equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs (such as opioids), greater use of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans, and embracing the role of a wider community support.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; head neck; palliative care; pandemic,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26211,Navigating the impact of COVID-19 on palliative care for head and neck cancer,"作者:Singh, AG (Singh, Arjun Gurmeet)[ 1 ] ; Deodhar, J (Deodhar, Jayita)[ 2 ] ; Chaturvedi, P (Chaturvedi, Pankaj)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Tata Mem Ctr & HBNI, Dept Head & Neck Oncol, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

The practices of head and neck surgical oncologists must evolve to meet the unprecedented needs placed on our health care system by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Guidelines are emerging to help guide the provision of head and neck cancer care, though in practice, it can be challenging to operationalize such recommendations. Head and neck surgeons at Wuhan University faced significant challenges in providing care for their patients. Similar challenges were faced by the University of Toronto during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced an abrupt change in the delivery of clinical services, including for individuals with an eating disorder. We present this Virtual Issue as a resource for the eating disorder community to showcase research published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders that provides information on effective strategies to help address the challenges arising from COVID-19-related disruptions. Articles included describe original research or systematic reviews on obstacles to health services use and strategies to improve access to care; technological tools to provide or enhance interventions; patients' and clinicians' attitudes or perspectives on using digital tools for clinical care; factors influencing therapeutic alliance; and ideas for improving reach and uptake of digital interventions. We hope that readers will find ways to observe and record their own experiences during this global crisis; the experiences of people at risk for developing or exhibiting an eating disorder; and the experiences of those who care for people with an eating disorder. These lived experiences will be invaluable in formulating hypotheses for future studies in service of advancing the understanding of eating disorders and improving interventions and policies for reducing the burden of suffering attributable to eating disorders.",作者关键词:access to care; barriers to care; digital interventions; efficacy; e-health; food insecurity; online treatment; telehealth; therapeutic alliance,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS,10.1002/eat.23279,Access to evidence-based care for eating disorders during the COVID-19 crisis,"作者:Weissman, RS (Weissman, Ruth S.)[ 1 ] ; Bauer, S (Bauer, Stephanie)[ 2 ] ; Thomas, JJ (Thomas, Jennifer J.)[ 3,4 ]",研究方向:Psychology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry,,APR 2020,"Wesleyan Univ, Dept Psychol, 207 High St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.

Objective The pandemic coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has pushed the global healthcare system to a crisis and amounted to a huge economic burden. Different drugs for prophylaxis against COVID-19 including chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been tried. This study was performed to systematically review the role of CQ and HCQ in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Methods PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 (pre-clinical studies) or COVID-19 (clinical studies) until 30 March 2020. The available literature was critically appraised.

Results A total of 45 articles were screened and 5 (3 in vitro pre-clinical studies and 2 clinical opinions) were included. The pre-clinical studies showed the prophylactic effects of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the clinical opinions advocated the prophylactic use of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19. However, no original clinical studies on the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on COVID-19 were available.

Conclusion Although pre-clinical results are promising, to date there is a dearth of evidence to support the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in preventing COVID-19. Considering potential safety issues and the likelihood of imparting a false sense of security, prophylaxis with CQ or HCQ against COVID-19 needs to be thoroughly evaluated in observational studies or high-quality randomized controlled studies.",作者关键词:chloroquine; COVID-19; high-risk; hydroxychloroquine; prevention; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RHEUMATIC DISEASES,10.1111/1756-185X.13842,A systematic review of the prophylactic role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19),"作者:Shah, SK (Shah, Sanket)[ 1 ] ; Das, S (Das, Saibal)[ 2 ] ; Jain, A (Jain, Avinash)[ 3 ] ; Misra, DP (Misra, Durga Prasanna)[ 4 ] ; Negi, VS (Negi, Vir Singh)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Rheumatology,,APR 2020,"Jawaharlal Inst Postgrad Med Educ & Res, Dept Clin Immunol, Pondicherry 605006, India.

"摘要
The Italian outbreak of COVID-19 cases is a public health emergency and there is a worldwide tremendous interest in the evaluation of the Italian epidemic evolution. Indeed, from February 2020, Italy is facing an explosion of COVID-19 cases. In particular, the Italian observed case fatality rate (CFR) is much higher than the other countries. Recently, it has been hypothesized that the extensive number of intergenerational contacts-typical of Italian culture-could contribute to explain the high number of deaths observed in Italy. However, through an analysis performed for all the Italian regions, here it is shown that the deaths are localized in specific regions and that the CFRs of different Italian regions are overlapping with the rates of European countries. Moreover, through correlation analyses between CFRs and different social habits, it is shown that no positive correlation is observed between social behaviors and CFRs. In conclusion, this analysis clearly rejects the possibility that social habits and intergenerational contacts can contribute to explaining such a profound effect on the number of deaths observed in Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak and more effort should be addressed to evaluate the real amount of positive cases.",作者关键词:case fatality rate; COVID-19; Italy; outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; social behavior,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25894,Case fatality rate analysis of Italian COVID-19 outbreak,"作者:Giangreco, G (Giangreco, Giovanni)",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,

"摘要
Background A relatively high mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is worrying, and the application of heparin in COVID-19 has been recommended by some expert consensus because of the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism. However, its efficacy remains to be validated.

Methods Coagulation results, medications, and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as having severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, as was a different risk of coagulopathy, which was stratified by the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result.

Results There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin) for 7 days or longer. D-dimer, prothrombin time, and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference in 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P = .910). But the 28-day mortality of heparin users was lower than nonusers in patients with SIC score >= 4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P = .029), or D-dimer >6-fold of upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, P = .017).

"摘要
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally since being identified as a public health emergency of major international concern and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors. Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, the potential challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic will be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches.

Implications for Practice The main management strategies for treating cancer patients during the COVID-19 epidemic include clear communication and education about hand hygiene, infection control measures, high-risk exposure, and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Consideration of risk and benefit for active intervention in the cancer population must be individualized. Postponing elective surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy for cancer patients with low risk of progression should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Minimizing outpatient visits can help to mitigate exposure and possible further transmission. Telemedicine may be used to support patients to minimize number of visits and risk of exposure. More research is needed to better understand SARS-CoV-2 virology and epidemiology.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Influenza; Neoplasm; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ONCOLOGIST,10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0213,A Practical Approach to the Management of Cancer Patients During the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An International Collaborative Group,"作者:Al-Shamsi, HO (Al-Shamsi, Humaid O.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Alhazzani, W (Alhazzani, Waleed)[ 4,5 ] ; Alhuraiji, A (Alhuraiji, Ahmad)[ 6 ] ; Coomes, EA (Coomes, Eric A.)[ 7 ] ; Chemaly, RF (Chemaly, Roy F.)[ 8 ] ; Almuhanna, M (Almuhanna, Meshari)[ 11 ] ; Wolff, RA (Wolff, Robert A.)[ 9 ] ; Ibrahim, NK (Ibrahim, Nuhad K.)[ 10 ] ; Chua, MLK (Chua, Melvin L.

BACKGROUND The first coronavirus (COVID-19) case was reported in United States in the state of Washington, approximately 3 months after the outbreak in Wuhan, China. Three weeks later, the US federal government declared the pandemic a national emergency. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases increased rather rapidly and changed routine daily activities of the community.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This brief report describes the response from the hospital, the regional blood center, and the hospital-based transfusion services to the events that took place in the community during the initial phases of the pandemic.

RESULTS In Washington State, the first week of March started with four confirmed cases and ended with 150; by the end of the second week of March there were more than 700 cases of confirmed COVID-19. During the first week, blood donations dropped significantly. Blood units provided from blood centers of nonaffected areas of the country helped keep inventory stable and allow for routine hospital operations. The hospital-based transfusion service began prospective triaging of blood orders to monitor and prioritize blood usage. In the second week, blood donations recovered, and the hospital postponed elective procedures to ensure staff and personal protective equipment were appropriate for the care of critical patients.

CONCLUSION As community activities are disrupted and hospital activities switch from routine operations to pandemic focused and urgent care oriented, the blood supply and usage requires a number of transformations.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,TRANSFUSION,10.1111/trf.15789,Prepare to adapt: blood supply and transfusion support during the first 2 weeks of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affecting Washington State,"作者:Pagano, MB (Pagano, Monica B.)[ 1,2 ] ; Hess, JR (Hess, John R.)[ 1,2 ] ; Tsang, HC (Tsang, Hamilton C.)[ 1 ] ; Staley, E (Staley, Elizabeth)[ 1 ] ; Gernsheimer, T (Gernsheimer, Terry)[ 1,2 ] ; Sen, NN (Sen, Nina)[ 1 ] ; Clark, C (Clark, Christine)[ 1 ] ; Nester, T (Nester, Theresa)[ 3 ] ; Bailey, C (Bailey, Curt)[ 3 ] ; Alcorn, K (Alcorn, Kirsten)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Hematology,,APR 2020,"Univ Washington, Hematol Div, Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest global economic and health challenge of the century. Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology.

Objective: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy regulations.

Methods: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).

Results: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR.

Conclusions: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation guidelines will limit data misuse.",作者关键词:COVID-19; contact tracing; Nigeria's National Data Protection Regulation; General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR; coronavirus; surveillance; mHealth; eHealth; digital health,文献类型:Article,JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,e19139,COVID-19 Mobile Positioning Data Contact Tracing and Patient Privacy Regulations: Exploratory Search of Global Response Strategies and the Use of Digital Tools in Nigeria,"作者:Ekong, I (Ekong, Iniobong)[ 1 ] ; Chukwu, E (Chukwu, Emeka)[ 2 ] ; Chukwu, M (Chukwu, Martha)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,,出版年: APR 27 2020,"Univ Malta, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Dept Comp Informat Syst, PG Room A24,Level 0, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral particles in the lung epithelium, the concentration of glycosylated angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in the lung epithelium, and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset, which may be related to both. Binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID-19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.",作者关键词:antibody-mediated cell-mediated cytotoxicity; antiviral agents; SARS coronavirus,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25887,"Hyperglycemia, hydroxychloroquine, and the COVID-19 pandemic","作者:Brufsky, A (Brufsky, Adam)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Magee Womens Hosp, UPMC Hillman Canc Ctr, Suite 4628,300 Halket St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.

Italy and the rest of the world are experiencing an outbreak of a novel beta-coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this context, in Italy, we reorganized the National Health System and prioritized the clinical cancer care scenario, balancing risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission versus the magnitude of clinical benefit deriving from a specific therapeutic approach. As initial actions, we recommended that routine screening be suspended and that patients with early and advanced cancer be treated as outpatients as much as possible and at the nearest medical center. Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment were protected from potential SARS-CoV-2 infection by creating a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway for cancer treatment. We implemented reorganization of the hospital networks, based on a hub-and-spoke design. Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer. Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome. Treatment strategies were discussed in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board. Treatment decision making balanced risk and benefits of treatment in the context of the specific pandemic level, on a case-by-case basis.",,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,ONCOLOGIST,10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0267,How to Guarantee the Best of Care to Patients with Cancer During the COVID-19 Epidemic: The Italian Experience,"作者:Curigliano, G (Curigliano, Giuseppe)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Oncology,,APR 2020,"IRCCS, European Inst Oncol, Via Ripamonti 435, I-20141 Milan, Italy.

"摘要
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has spread to Italy with heavy consequences on public health and economics. Besides the possible consequences of COVID-19 infection on a pregnant woman and the fetus, a major concern is related to the potential effect on neonatal outcome, the appropriate management of the mother-newborn dyad, and finally the compatibility of maternal COVID-19 infection with breastfeeding. The Italian Society on Neonatology (SIN) after reviewing the limited scientific knowledge on the compatibility of breastfeeding in the COVID-19 mother and the available statements from Health Care Organizations has issued the following indications that have been endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal & Perinatal Societies (UENPS). If a mother previously identified as COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19 is asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic at delivery, rooming-in is feasible, and direct breastfeeding is advisable, under strict measures of infection control. On the contrary, when a mother with COVID-19 is too sick to care for the newborn, the neonate will be managed separately and fed fresh expressed breast milk, with no need to pasteurize it, as human milk is not believed to be a vehicle of COVID-19. We recognize that this guidance might be subject to change in the future when further knowledge will be acquired about the COVID-19 pandemic, the perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and clinical characteristics of cases of neonatal COVID-19.",作者关键词:birth; breastfeeding; breastfeeding promotion; human milk; infectious disease; neonate,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION,e13010,Breastfeeding and coronavirus disease-2019: Ad interim indications of the Italian Society of Neonatology endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal & Perinatal Societies,"作者:Davanzo, R (Davanzo, Riccardo)[ 1,2 ] ; Moro, G (Moro, Guido)[ 3 ] ; Sandri, F (Sandri, Fabrizio)[ 4 ] ; Agosti, M (Agosti, Massimo)[ 5 ] ; Moretti, C (Moretti, Corrado)[ 6,7 ] ; Mosca, F (Mosca, Fabio)[ 8,9 ]",研究方向:Nutrition & Dietetics; Pediatrics,No specific funding was related to the production of this work ,10.1111/mcn.13010,"IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Inst Maternal & Child Hlth, Via Istria 65-1, I-34100 Trieste, Italy.

The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is impacting transplant programs around the world, and, as the center of the pandemic shifts to the United States, we have to prepare to make decisions about which patients to transplant during times of constrained resources. In this paper, we discuss how to transition from the traditional justice vs utility consideration in organ allocation to a more nuanced allocation scheme based on ethical values that drive decisions in times of absolute scarcity. We recognize that many decisions are made based on the practical limitations that transplant programs face, especially at the extremes. As programs make the transition from a standard approach to a resource-constrained approach to transplantation, we utilize a framework for ethical decisions in settings of absolutely scarce resources to help guide programs in deciding which patients to transplant, which donors to accept, how to minimize risk, and how to ensure the best utilization of transplant team members.",作者关键词:editorial; personal viewpoint; ethics; ethics and public policy; infection and infectious agents - viral; infectious disease; organ acceptance; organ allocation; organ procurement and allocation; organ transplantation in general; patient safety,文献类型:Article; Early Access,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPLANTATION,10.1111/ajt.15914,Coronavirus disease 2019: Utilizing an ethical framework for rationing absolutely scarce health-care resources in transplant allocation decisions,"作者:Wall, AE (Wall, Anji E.)[ 1 ] ; Pruett, T (Pruett, Timothy)[ 2 ] ; Stock, P (Stock, Peter)[ 3 ] ; Testa, G (Testa, Giuliano)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Surgery; Transplantation,,APR 2020,"Baylor Univ, Med Ctr, Annette C & Harold C Simmons Transplant Inst, Dallas, TX 75226 USA.

"摘要
Chronic pain causes significant suffering, limitation of daily activities and reduced quality of life. Infection from COVID-19 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to systemic complications and death. Led by the World Health Organization, healthcare systems across the world are engaged in limiting the spread of infection. As a result, all elective surgical procedures, outpatient procedures and patient visits, including pain management services, have been postponed or cancelled. This has affected the care of chronic pain patients. Most are elderly with multiple comorbidities, which puts them at risk of COVID-19 infection. Important considerations that need to be recognised during this pandemic for chronic pain patients include: ensuring continuity of care and pain medications, especially opioids; use of telemedicine; maintaining biopsychosocial management; use of anti-inflammatory drugs; use of steroids; and prioritising necessary procedural visits. There are no guidelines to inform physicians and healthcare providers engaged in caring for patients with pain during this period of crisis. We assembled an expert panel of pain physicians, psychologists and researchers from North America and Europe to formulate recommendations to guide practice. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, these recommendations are based on the best available evidence and expert opinion at this present time and may need adapting to local workplace policies.",作者关键词:chronic pain; COVID-19; opioids; recommendations; steroids,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15076,Caring for patients with pain during the COVID-19 pandemic: consensus recommendations from an international expert panel,"作者:Shanthanna, H (Shanthanna, H.)[ 1 ] ; Strand, NH (Strand, N.

"摘要
This paper uses the information implicit in commodity futures and options prices to infer market beliefs about the impact of early-stages COVID-19 on commodity market fundamentals. The particular commodity examined is soft red winter (SRW) wheat, and the timeframe is early February to late March 2020. The analysis highlights various adjustments in the cash and futures price of SRW wheat in light of surging short-run demand from consumer hoarding of staple food products, and a weakening long-run market from growing wheat stocks and an emerging global recession. This split is causing the forward curve to flatten and basis levels to invert. The change over time in the price of options on wheat futures reveals increased price volatility in response to growing uncertainty about the COVID-19 impacts. Similarly, changes in the skewness of the option's volatility smile illustrate a shift in traders' perception about risk in the right versus left tail of the price distribution.",作者关键词:commodity futures; COVID-19; options; price volatility,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE,10.1111/cjag.12229,Information-rich wheat markets in the early days of COVID-19,"作者:Vercammen, J (Vercammen, James)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Agriculture; Business & Economics,,APR 2020,"Fac Land & Food Syst, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

"摘要
The effect of COVID-19 on Canadian food security is examined from two different perspectives. COVID-19 creates a unique ""income shock"" that is expected to increase the prevalence of household food insecurity. This food insecurity can be measured by utilizing the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). More fundamentally, COVID-19 heightens household concern about the capacity of the Canadian food system to ensure food availability. Despite surges in demand and supply chain disruptions, we currently do not observe broad, rapid appreciation in food prices. This suggests that there is an adequate supply of food for the near term. There is less certainty over intermediate and longer time periods because so many factors are in flux, particularly the rate of increases in sicknesses and deaths across the country and globally. Data on these health factors and elements of the food supply chain are needed to predict beyond a short time frame. In this regard, we discuss three ongoing considerations-ease of capital flows, international exchange, and maintaining transportation-that will help ensure food availability in the longer run.",作者关键词:COVID-19; food security,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE,10.1111/cjag.12227,Food security and Canada's agricultural system challenged by COVID-19,"作者:Deaton, BJ (Deaton, B.

Purpose The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in tears and conjunctival samples from infected individuals. Conjunctivitis is also reported in a small number of cases. We evaluated ocular symptoms and ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in a group of patients with COVID-19.

Method Fifty-six patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited as subjects. Relevant medical histories were obtained from the electronic medical record system. Ocular history and ocular symptoms data were obtained by communicating directly with the subjects. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Salisbury Eye Evaluation Questionnaire (SEEQ) were used to assess the anterior ocular surface condition before and after the onset of disease.

Results Patients classified as severe COVID-19 cases were more likely to have hypertension compared to mild cases (p = 0.035). Of the 56 subjects, thirteen patients (23%) were infected in Wuhan, 32 patients (57%) were community-infected, 10 patients (18%) were unknown origin, 1 (2%) was a physician likely infected by a confirmed patient. Three patients wore face mask with precaution when contacting the confirmed patients. Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset. The differences in mean scores of OSDI questionnaire and SEEQ between before and after onset of COVID-19 were all significant (p < 0.05 for both).

Conclusions Ocular symptoms are relatively common in COVID-19 disease and may appear just before the onset of respiratory symptoms.

"摘要
In this rapid commentary, a mini-review is given of the present state-of-knowledge regarding the etiology and epidemiology of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and the risks for developing Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The available knowledge on the viral genomics, molecular biology and pathogenicity of viruses of the Coronaviridae family and other Nidovirales, forms a helpful template for understanding the present pandemic outbreak. However, important questions remain unanswered about the underlying mechanism causing the very high case fatality ratios (CFR) and mechanisms regarding severe reactions like ARDS, fatal cardiac and renal failures, associated with a number of important comorbidity factors. Immunological reactions to lung alveoles in particular (involving lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cell damage) in late phase ARDS in SARS-like CoV diseases, so far may not have received enough attention. Finally a shortlist of questions for high priority further research is suggested.",作者关键词:COVID-19 (2019-nCoV); SARS; MERS; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Lung immunopathology,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ACTA BIOTHEORETICA,10.1007/s10441-020-09382-z,How Could This Happen?

"摘要
Purpose This article aims to share northern Italy's experience in hospital re-organization and management of clinical pathways for traumatic and orthopaedic patients in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. Results Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Conclusion The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.",作者关键词:Orthopaedic; Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Traumatology; Triage; Pathways,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY,10.1007/s00167-020-06023-3,Management of orthopaedic and traumatology patients during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in northern Italy,"作者:Randelli, PS (Randelli, Pietro Simone)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Compagnoni, R (Compagnoni, Riccardo)[ 1,2,3 ]",研究方向:Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Milan, Dept Biomed Sci Hlth, Lab Appl Biomech, Via Mangiagalli 31, I-20133 Milan, Italy.

"摘要
Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by. Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable ""real-time"" monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.","作者关键词:Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; Infection; Pandemic; Epidemics; Predictive preventive personalised (3P) medicine; Bottle-neck; Strategy; Targeted protective measures; Multi-professional expertise; Laboratory medicine; Policymaking; Salami-tactic; Population screening; ""Real-time"" monitoring; Home isolation; Comorbidities; Related mortality; Depression; Suppressed immune defence; Suicide; Psychotic attitude; Violence; Anti-gene; Anti-body; Test; Individual outcomes; Ethics; Titanic; Triage; Economy",文献类型:Letter; Early Access,EPMA JOURNAL,10.1007/s13167-020-00207-0,"Covid-19 pandemic by the ""real-time"" monitoring: the Tunisian case and lessons for global epidemics in the context of 3PM strategies","作者:Chaari, L (Chaari, Lotfi)[ 1 ] ; Golubnitschaja, O (Golubnitschaja, Olga)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine; Research & Experimental Medicine,,APR 2020,"Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Predict Prevent & Personalised 3P Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Bonn, Germany.

This study seeks to examine and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks and identify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and changing trends of cases. Hence, local outlier analysis and emerging spatiotemporal hot spot analysis were performed to analyze the spatiotemporal clustering pattern and cold/hot spot trends of COVID-19 cases based on space-time cube during the period from 23 January 2020 to 24 February 2020. The main findings are as follows: (1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the current totality incidence rate has decreased. (2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases was uneven. In terms of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan city were the center as both cities had high-high clustering pattern with a surrounding unstable multiple-type pattern in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing city. Those regions are continuously in the hot spot on the spatiotemporal tendency. (3) The spatiotemporal analysis technology based on the space-time cube can analyze comprehensively the spatiotemporal pattern of epidemiological data and produce a visual output of the consequences, which can reflect intuitively the distribution and trend of data in space-time. Therefore, the Chinese government should strengthen the prevention and control efforts in a targeted manner to cope with a highly changeable situation.",作者关键词:COVID-19; emerging spatiotemporal hot spots analysis; local outlier analysis; space-time cube,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25834,An analysis of spatiotemporal pattern for COIVD-19 in China based on space-time cube,"作者:Mo, CB (Mo, Chunbao)[ 1 ] ; Tan, DC (Tan, Dechan)[ 2 ] ; Mai, TY (Mai, Tingyu)[ 2 ] ; Bei, CH (Bei, Chunhua)[ 3 ] ; Qin, J (Qin, Jian)[ 4 ] ; Pang, WY (Pang, Weiyi)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, ZY (Zhang, Zhiyong)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Virology,Guangxi Graduate Education Innovation Project ,APR 2020,"Guilin Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth & Occupat Med, Huan Cheng North 2nd Rd 109, Guilin 541004, Guangxi, Peoples R China.

This Regular Feature explores the role of health science librarians in the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 has spread rapidly all over the world. All major cities around the globe are in lockdown. In Pakistan, the first case was diagnosed on 26 February 2020, and currently, there are more than 2039 diagnosed cases and 26 deaths as on 31 March 2020. Across the country, there are further 12 000 suspected cases. This will undoubtedly increase if precautionary measures are not taken. Pakistani universities, colleges and schools were in lockdown. The role of university librarians in this emergency included raising awareness through public health education, providing support to medical staff, researchers and providing ongoing traditional services to regular library patrons in Pakistan. The Regular Feature also provides links to useful resources.

AimThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has put health care workers at risk when exposed to aerosolized viral particles during upper airway mucosal surgery. The objective of this review was to discuss topical preparations that could be utilized preoperatively to help to decrease viral load and potentially reduce the risks of viral transmission.

MethodsA PubMed/MEDLINE database review of articles was performed querying topical preparations with virucidal activity against coronaviruses.

ResultsPovidone-iodine (PVP-I) solutions ranging from 0.23% to 7% have been found to demonstrate highly effective virucidal activity against a broad range of viruses including several coronaviruses responsible for recent epidemics including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.

ConclusionsWhile specific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 is lacking, PVP-I-based preparations have been successfully demonstrated to reduce viral loads of coronaviruses. They are relatively safe to use in the upper airway and may reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization during upper airway mucosal surgery.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; head and neck cancer; safety; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26200,Topical preparations to reduce SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization in head and neck mucosal surgery,"作者:Parhar, HS (Parhar, Harman S.)[ 1 ] ; Tasche, K (Tasche, Kendall)[ 1 ] ; Brody, RM (Brody, Robert M.)[ 1 ] ; Weinstein, GS (Weinstein, Gregory S.)[ 1 ] ; O'Malley, BW (O'Malley, Bert W., Jr.)[ 1 ] ; Shanti, RM (Shanti, Rabie M.)[ 1,2 ] ; Newman, JG (Newman, Jason G.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 3400 Spruce St,5 Ravdin, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

Objective There is a paucity of clinical data on critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal life support.

Methods A statewide multi-institutional collaborative for COVID-19 patients was utilized to obtain clinical data on the first 10 critically ill COVID-19 patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Results Of the first 10 patients that required ECMO for COVID-19, the age ranged from 31 to 62 years with the majority (70%) being men. Seven (70%) had comorbidities. The majority (80%) of patients had known sick contact and exposure to COVID-19 positive patients or traveled to pandemic areas inside the United States within the 2 weeks before symptom onset. None of the patients were healthcare workers. The most common symptoms leading to the presentation were high fever >= 103 degrees F (90%), cough (80%) and dyspnea (70%), followed by fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms (both 30%), myalgia, loss of taste, pleuritic chest pain, and confusion (all 10%). All patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest X-rays suggestive of interstitial viral pneumonia. All patients were cannulated in the venovenous configuration. Two (20%) patients were successfully liberated from ECMO support after 7 and 10 days, respectively, and one (10%) patient is currently on a weaning course. One patient (10%) died after 9 days on ECMO from multiorgan dysfunction.

Conclusions These preliminary multi-institutional data from a statewide collaborative offer insight into the clinical characteristics of the first 10 patients requiring ECMO for COVID-19 and their initial clinical course. Greater morbidity and mortality is likely to be seen in these critically ill patients with longer follow-up.",作者关键词:cardiogenic shock; coronavirus; COVID-19; ECMO,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY,10.1111/jocs.14583,The role of extracorporeal life support for patients with COVID-19: Preliminary results from a statewide experience,"作者:Sultan, I (Sultan, Ibrahim)[ 1,2 ] ; Habertheuer, A (Habertheuer, Andreas)[ 1 ] ; Usman, AA (Usman, Asad A.)[ 3 ] ; Kilic, A (Kilic, Arman)[ 1 ] ; Gnall, E (Gnall, Eric)[ 4 ] ; Friscia, ME (Friscia, Michael E.)[ 5 ] ; Zubkus, D (Zubkus, Dmitriy)[ 6 ] ; Hirose, H (Hirose, Hitoshi)[ 7 ] ; Sanchez, P (Sanchez, Pablo)[ 1 ] ; Okusanya, O (Okusanya, Olugbenga)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Pittsburgh, Div Cardiac Surg, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 5200 Ctr Ave,Suite 715, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA.

"摘要
In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally. However, the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the excreta of COVID-19 patients. Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool, and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and its correlation analyzed with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, and this was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in the feces after the pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from the feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity. The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did not differ between patients who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces. Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients. Our results demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of COVID-19 patients and suggested the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route.",作者关键词:coronavirus disease 2019; fecal-oral transmission; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral RNA; viral shedding,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25825,The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of COVID-19 patients,"作者:Chen, YF (Chen, Yifei)[ 1 ] ; Chen, LJ (Chen, Liangjun)[ 2 ] ; Deng, QL (Deng, Qiaoling)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, GQ (Zhang, Guqin)[ 1 ] ; Wu, KS (Wu, Kaisong)[ 1 ] ; Ni, L (Ni, Lan)[ 1 ] ; Yang, YB (Yang, Yibin)[ 1 ] ; Liu, B (Liu, Bing)[ 1 ] ; Wang, W (Wang, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Wei, CJ (Wei, Chaojie)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Zhongnan Hosp, Donghu Rd 169, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The 2019 novel-coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 181 countries with approximately 1197405 confirmed cases (by 5th April). Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which got affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies are critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-19 reported cases show that more than 80% of infected are mild cases of disease, around 14% of infected have severe complications, and about 5% are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (5th April 2020; daily updates in the prepared website) shows that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, Italy, and Germany are 308850, 126168, 124632, and 96092, respectively. Calculating the total case fatality rate (CFR) of Italy (4th April 2020), about 13.3% of confirmed cases have passed away. Compared with South Korea's rate of 1.8% (seven times lower than Italy) and China's 4% (69% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. Some effective policies that yielded significant changes in the trend of cases were the lockdown policy in China, Italy, and Spain (the effect observed after some days), the shutdown of all nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea, and reducing working hours in Iran.",作者关键词:biostatistics and bioinformatics; coronavirus; data processing; epidemiology; infection; test statistics; virus classification,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25885,Understanding epidemic data and statistics: A case study of COVID-19,"作者:Dehkordi, AH (Dehkordi, Amirhoshang Hoseinpour)[ 1 ] ; Alizadeh, M (Alizadeh, Majid)[ 2 ] ; Derakhshan, P (Derakhshan, Pegah)[ 3 ] ; Babazadeh, P (Babazadeh, Peyman)[ 4 ] ; Jahandideh, A (Jahandideh, Arash)[ 5 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Tehran 141556455, Iran.

A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other cities and countries. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated. A well-mixed ""susceptible exposed infectious recovered"" (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.",作者关键词:contact rate; COVID-19; latent individuals; SEIR compartmental model,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25827,The effectiveness of quarantine of Wuhan city against the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A well-mixed SEIR model analysis,"作者:Hou, C (Hou, Can)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, JX (Chen, Jiaxin)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhou, YQ (Zhou, Yaqing)[ 1,2 ] ; Hua, L (Hua, Lei)[ 1,2 ] ; Yuan, JX (Yuan, Jinxia)[ 1,2 ] ; He, S (He, Shu)[ 1,2 ] ; Guo, Y (Guo, Yi)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhang, S (Zhang, Sheng)[ 1,2 ] ; Jia, QW (Jia, Qiaowei)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhao, CH (Zhao, Chenhui)[ 1,2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Jiangsu Prov Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Guangzhou Rd 300, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

"摘要
COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic; early identification of severe illness is critical for controlling it and improving the prognosis of patients with limited medical resources. The present study aimed to analyze the characteristics of severe COVID-19 and identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction. In total, 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 75 patients with flu were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical parameters were collected from electronic medical records. The disease course was divided into four stages: initial, progression, peak, and recovery stages, according to computed tomography (CT) progress. to mild COVID-19, the lymphocytes in the severe COVID-19 progressively decreased at the progression and the peak stages, but rebound in the recovery stage. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the severe group at the initial and progression stages were higher than those in the mild group. Correlation analysis showed that CRP (R = .62; P < .01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (R = .55; P < .01) and granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio (R = .49; P < .01) were positively associated with the CT severity scores. In contrast, the number of lymphocytes (R = -.37; P < .01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID-19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10-1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut-off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively. CRP in severe COVID-19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings. Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID-19.",作者关键词:COVID-19; C-reactive protein; SARS-COVID-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25871,C-reactive protein correlates with computed tomographic findings and predicts severe COVID-19 early,"作者:Tan, CC (Tan, Chaochao)[ 1 ] ; Huang, Y (Huang, Ying)[ 2 ] ; XShi, FX (Shi, Fengxia)[ 3 ] ; Tan, K (Tan, Kui)[ 1 ] ; Ma, QH (Ma, Qionghui)[ 4 ] ; Chen, Y (Chen, Yong)[ 4 ] ; Jiang, XX (Jiang, Xixin)[ 5 ] ; Li, XS (Li, Xiaosong)[ 6 ]",研究方向:Virology,Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Project of Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department ,APR 2020,"Hunan Normal Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hunan Prov Peoples Hosp, Dept Clin Epidemiol Res, 61 Jiefang Rd, Changsha 410005, Hunan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and presented a major threat to public health. Nationwide, there were more than 70 000 confirmed cases and 2500 deaths. Most patients were elderly, with severe disease. For acute respiratory infection, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used to detect causative viruses in respiratory secretions. Coronavirus RNA can be detected from nose and throat swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, and feces. Such specimens were examined by RT-PCR. Three targets, RdRP, E, and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. After patient recovery, a chest computed tomography examination, combined with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, confirmed diagnosis. However, some recovery patients with negative RNA tests turned RNA positive. The preliminary data is about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong reported by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC). This is an important scientific issue. If samples are positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, patients should be managed according to infection source. Fortunately, there were no close contacts of second-generation cases. We herein report six SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed in our hospital, for the changes of results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should attract attention. Most patients were elderly, with a low Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). However, the association of the phenomenon with aging and GNRI has not yet been reported in detail. Further investigations are necessary to confirm and improve these findings. Similarly, discharged patient follow-up should be strengthened.",作者关键词:COVID-19; elderly; GNRI; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25796,"Caution should be exercised for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the elderly","作者:Yuan, YJ (Yuan, Yajun)[ 1 ] ; Wang, N (Wang, Nan)[ 2 ] ; Ou, XQ (Ou, Xueqing)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Gerontol & Geriatr, Affiliated Hosp 5, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the world has caused a large infected population suffering from COVID-19. To curb the spreading of the virus, WHO urgently demanded an extension of screening and testing; thus, a rapid and simple diagnostic method is needed. We applied a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to achieve the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min. We designed four sets of LAMP primers (6 primers in each set), targeting the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the regions of orf1ab, S gene and N gene. A colorimetric change was used to report the results, which enables the outcome of viral RNA amplification to be read by the naked eye without the need of expensive or dedicated instrument. The sensitivity can be 80 copies of viral RNA per ml in a sample. We validated the RT-LAMP method in a hospital in China, employing 16 clinic samples with 8 positives and 8 negatives. The testing results are consistent with the conventional RT-qPCR. In addition, we also show that one-step process without RNA extraction is feasible to achieve RNA amplification directly from a sample. This rapid, simple and sensitive RT-LAMP method paves a way for a large screening at public domain and hospitals, particularly regional hospitals and medical centres in rural areas.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY,10.1111/1751-7915.13586,RT-LAMP for rapid diagnosis of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"作者:Huang, WE (Huang, Wei E.)[ 1,2 ] ; Lim, B (Lim, Boon)[ 2 ] ; Hsu, CC (Hsu, Chia-Chen)[ 2,3 ] ; Xiong, D (Xiong, Dan)[ 4 ] ; Wu, W (Wu, Wei)[ 4 ] ; Yu, YJ (Yu, Yejiong)[ 2,3 ] ; Jia, HD (Jia, Huidong)[ 1 ] ; Wang, Y (Wang, Yun)[ 1 ] ; Zeng, YD (Zeng, Yida)[ 1 ] ; Ji, MM (Ji, Mengmeng)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology,"Oxford Suzhou Centre for Advanced Research (OSCAR), University of Oxford ",APR 2020,"Univ Oxford, OSCAR, Suzhou Ind Pk, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to a worldwide shortage of ventilators. This shortage has initiated discussions on how to support multiple patients with a single ventilator (ventilator splitting). Ventilator splitting is incompletely tested, experimental and the effects have not been fully characterised. This study investigated the effect of ventilator splitting on system variables (inspiratory pressure, flow and volume) and the possibility of different ventilation targets for each limb using only standard hospital equipment. Experiments were conducted on two test lungs with different compliances (0.02 l.cmH(2)O(-1) and 0.04 l.cmH(2)O(-1)). The ventilator was used in both pressure and volume control modes and was set to ventilate the low compliance lungs at end-tidal volumes of 500 +/- 20 ml. A flow restrictor apparatus consisting of a Hoffman clamp and tracheal tube was connected in series to the inspiratory limb of the high compliance test lungs and the resistance modified to achieve end-tidal volumes of 500 +/- 20 ml. The restriction apparatus successfully modified the inspiratory pressure, minute ventilation and volume delivered to the high compliance test lungs in both pressure control (27.3-17.8 cmH(2)O, 15.2-8.0 l.min(-1) and 980-499 ml, respectively) and volume control (21.0-16.7 cmH(2)O, 10.7-7.9 l.min(-1) and 659-498 ml, respectively) ventilation modes. Ventilator splitting is not condoned by the authors. However, these experiments demonstrate the capacity to simultaneously ventilate two test lungs of different compliances, and using only standard hospital equipment, modify the delivered pressure, flow and volume in each test lung.",作者关键词:COVID-19; lung protective ventilation; pandemic; splitting; ventilation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15078,Coping with COVID-19: ventilator splitting with differential driving pressures using standard hospital equipment,"作者:Clarke, AL (Clarke, A.

"摘要
Our public health approaches to addressing COVID-19 are heavily dependent on social and behavioral change strategies to halt transmissions. To date, biomedical forms of curative and preventative treatments for COVID-19 are at best limited. Four decades into the HIV epidemic we have learned a considerable amount of information regarding social and behavioral approaches to addressing disease transmission. Here we outline broad, scoping lessons learned from the HIV literature tailored to the nature of what we currently know about COVID-19. We focus on multiple levels of intervention including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and social factors, each of which provide a reference point for understanding and elaborating on social/behavioral lessons learned from HIV prevention and treatment research. The investments in HIV prevention and treatment research far outweigh any infectious disease in the history of public health, that is, until now with the emergence of COVID-19.",,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,10.1007/s10865-020-00157-y,Social and behavioral health responses to COVID-19: lessons learned from four decades of an HIV pandemic,"作者:Eaton, LA (Eaton, Lisa A.)[ 1 ] ; Kalichman, SC (Kalichman, Seth C.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Psychology,,APR 2020,"Univ Connecticut, Human Dev & Family Sci, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.

"摘要
The COVID-19 pandemic presents clinicians a unique set of challenges in managing breast cancer (BC) patients. As hospital resources and staff become more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critically important to define which BC patients require more urgent care and which patients can wait for treatment until the pandemic is over. In this Special Communication, we use expert opinion of representatives from multiple cancer care organizations to categorize BC patients into priority levels (A, B, C) for urgency of care across all specialties. Additionally, we provide treatment recommendations for each of these patient scenarios. Priority A patients have conditions that are immediately life threatening or symptomatic requiring urgent treatment. Priority B patients have conditions that do not require immediate treatment but should start treatment before the pandemic is over. Priority C patients have conditions that can be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. The implementation of these recommendations for patient triage, which are based on the highest level available evidence, must be adapted to current availability of hospital resources and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region of the country. Additionally, the risk of disease progression and worse outcomes for patients need to be weighed against the risk of patient and staff exposure to SARS CoV-2 (virus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic). Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.",,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT,10.1007/s10549-020-05644-z,"Recommendations for prioritization, treatment, and triage of breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. the COVID-19 pandemic breast cancer consortium","作者:Dietz, JR (Dietz, Jill R.)[ 1,2,6 ] ; Moran, MS (Moran, Meena S.)[ 1,3,7 ] ; Isakoff, SJ (Isakoff, Steven J.)[ 3,8 ] ; Kurtzman, SH (Kurtzman, Scott H.)[ 1,9 ] ; Willey, SC (Willey, Shawna C.)[ 2,10 ] ; Burstein, HJ (Burstein, Harold J.)[ 3 ] ; Bleicher, RJ (Bleicher, Richard J.)[ 1,3,11,12 ] ; Lyons, JA (Lyons, Janice A.)[ 6 ] ; Sarantou, T (Sarantou, Terry)[ 1,13 ] ; Baron, PL (Baron, Paul L.)[ 1,2,14 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Oncology,,APR 2020,"Natl Accreditat Program Breast Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new infectious disease that first emerged in Hubei province, China, in December 2019, which was found to be associated with a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan. Airway epithelial cells from infected patients were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named the SARS-CoV-2, on January 12, 2020, which is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome sequences obtained from infected patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV. The possible person-to-person disease rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries. Without a therapeutic vaccine or specific antiviral drugs, early detection and isolation become essential against novel Coronavirus. In this review, we introduced current diagnostic methods and criteria for the SARS-CoV-2 in China and discuss the advantages and limitations of the current diagnostic methods, including chest imaging and laboratory detection.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Origin; Diagnosis,文献类型:Review; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1007/s10096-020-03899-4,"The genetic sequence, origin, and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2","作者:Wang, HH (Wang, Huihui)[ 1 ] ; Li, XM (Li, Xuemei)[ 1 ] ; Li, T (Li, Tao)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhang, SB (Zhang, Shubing)[ 1 ] ; Wang, LZ (Wang, Lianzi)[ 1 ] ; Wu, X (Wu, Xian)[ 1 ] ; Liu, JQ (Liu, Jiaqing)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Anhui Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Clin Lab, Hefei 230032, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading in Japan. We have collected a total of 26 patients with COVID-19 who required extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). The available data from the first 14 cases demonstrated that the median age of patients was 71 and the median PaO2/FIO2 ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, and lung compliance were 70, 15 cmH(2)O, 21 cmH(2)O, and 28 mL/cmH(2)O, respectively. Median serum KL-6 level was 333 U/mL. Consequently, 16 (62%) out of the 26 have been weaned off and 6 (26%) have been extubated and on rehabilitation, while the other 10 (38%) remain on ECMO. There seemed to be two phenotypes of COVID-19: one with impaired lung compliance and one with preserved lung compliance. The latter phenotype was likely to be favored from the use of ECMO.

"摘要
The informal settlements of the Global South are the least prepared for the pandemic of COVID-19 since basic needs such as water, toilets, sewers, drainage, waste collection, and secure and adequate housing are already in short supply or non-existent. Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here. At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.",作者关键词:Slums; Informal settlements; Equity; Coronavirus; Community health; Global health,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11524-020-00438-6,Slum Health: Arresting COVID-19 and Improving Well-Being in Urban Informal Settlements,"作者:Corburn, J (Corburn, Jason)[ 1,2 ] ; Vlahov, D (Vlahov, David)[ 3 ] ; Mberu, B (Mberu, Blessing)[ 4 ] ; Riley, L (Riley, Lee)[ 5 ] ; Caiaffa, WT (Caiaffa, Waleska Teixeira)[ 6 ] ; Rashid, SF (Rashid, Sabina Faiz)[ 7 ] ; Ko, A (Ko, Albert)[ 8 ] ; Patel, S (Patel, Sheela)[ 9 ] ; Jukur, S (Jukur, Smurti)[ 9 ] ; Martinez-Herrera, E (Martinez-Herrera, Eliana)[ 10 ] ...更多内容","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine",,APR 2020,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread not only in China but throughout the world. Children with kidney failure (chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5) are at significant risk for COVID-19. In turn, a set of recommendations for the prevention and control of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 in pediatric hemodialysis (HD) centers and in home peritoneal dialysis (PD) settings have been proposed. The recommendations are based on the epidemiological features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease, susceptibility factors, and preventive and control strategies. These recommendations will be updated as new information regarding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 becomes available.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Dialysis; Children,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY,10.1007/s00467-020-04555-x,Consensus recommendations for the care of children receiving chronic dialysis in association with the COVID-19 epidemic,"作者:Shen, Q (Shen, Qian)[ 1 ] ; Wang, M (Wang, Mo)[ 2 ] ; Che, RC (Che, Ruochen)[ 3 ] ; Li, Q (Li, Qiu)[ 2 ] ; Zhou, JH (Zhou, Jianhua)[ 4 ] ; Wang, F (Wang, Fang)[ 5 ] ; Shen, Y (Shen, Ying)[ 6 ] ; Ding, J (Ding, Jie)[ 5 ] ; Huang, SM (Huang, Songming)[ 3 ] ; Yap, HK (Yap, Hui-Kim)[ 7 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Pediatrics; Urology & Nephrology,,APR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Childrens Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency. An attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease (M-pro, also called 3CL(pro)) because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. We report the x-ray structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M-pro and its complex with an alpha-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. On the basis of the unliganded structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.",,文献类型:Article,SCIENCE,10.1126/science.abb3405,Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease provides a basis for design of improved alpha-ketoamide inhibitors,"作者:Zhang, LL (Zhang, Linlin)[ 1,2 ] ; Lin, DZ (Lin, Daizong)[ 1,3 ] ; Sun, XYY (Sun, Xinyuanyuan)[ 1,2 ] ; Curth, U (Curth, Ute)[ 4 ] ; Drosten, C (Drosten, Christian)[ 5 ] ; Sauerhering, L (Sauerhering, Lucie)[ 6,7 ] ; Becker, S (Becker, Stephan)[ 6,7 ] ; Rox, K (Rox, Katharina)[ 8,9 ] ; Hilgenfeld, R (Hilgenfeld, Rolf)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) ,出版年: APR 24 2020,"Univ Lubeck, Inst Biochem, Ctr Struct & Cell Biol Med, D-23562 Lubeck, Germany.

"摘要
The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the provision of mental health services. In response, policymakers, administrators, and providers have taken bold steps toward enabling telepsychiatry to bridge this sudden gap in care for our most vulnerable populations. With rapid deregulation and adoption of this modality of care, careful consideration of issues related to policy and implementation is essential to maximize its effectiveness and mitigate unintended consequences. Though the crisis places the healthcare system under strain, it sets the stage for a lasting shift in not only how care is delivered, but also our beliefs around the system's capacity for rapid, innovative change.",作者关键词:Telepsychiatry; Policy; Pandemic; Disaster,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY IN MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1007/s10488-020-01044-z,Mobilization of Telepsychiatry in Response to COVID-19-Moving Toward 21(st) Century Access to Care,"作者:Kannarkat, JT (Kannarkat, Jacob T.)[ 1 ] ; Smith, NN (Smith, Noah N.)[ 1 ] ; McLeod-Bryant, SA (McLeod-Bryant, Stephen A.)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,APR 2020,"Univ Miami Heath Syst, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1695 NW 9th Ave,Suite 3100, Miami, FL 33136 USA.

"摘要
Among the Australian and UK governments' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the designation of outlets selling alcohol for off-premise consumption as 'essential' services, allowing them to remain open while pubs, hotels and restaurants have been forced to close. In a context of restrictions on movement outside the home in both countries, and where alcohol providers are trying to find new ways to reach their customers, this may lead to an intensification of the social and health harms associated with home drinking. By examining the current situation in both Australia and the UK, we argue that heightened risks from home drinking amid COVID-19 bring into sharp focus long-standing weaknesses within licensing systems in both countries: the regulation of off-premise outlets to minimise harms from drinking at home. We call for critical conversations on how licensing systems should be revised to take more responsibility for protecting people from the health and social harms associated with home drinking, both under COVID-19 and in the future.",作者关键词:alcohol; COVID-19,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW,10.1111/dar.13076,Accessibility of 'essential' alcohol in the time of COVID-19: Casting light on the blind spots of licensing?,"作者:Reynolds, J (Reynolds, Joanna)[ 1 ] ; Wilkinson, C (Wilkinson, Claire)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Substance Abuse,Sheffield Hallam University ,APR 2020,"Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Psychol Sociol & Polit, City Campus,Howard St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire S1 1WB, England.

"摘要
In the early February, 2020, we called up an experts' committee with more than 30 Chinese experts from 11 national medical academic organizations to formulate the first edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children, which has been published in this journal. With accumulated experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, we have updated the consensus statement and released the second edition recently. The current version in English is a condensed version of the second edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children. In the current version, diagnosis and treatement criteria have been optimized, and early identification of severe and critical cases is highlighted. The early warning indicators for severe pediatric cases have been summarized which is utmost important for clinical practice. This version of experts consensus will be valuable for better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children worldwide.",作者关键词:Children; COVID-19; Infection; SARS-CoV-2; Treatment,文献类型:Review; Early Access,WORLD JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,10.1007/s12519-020-00362-4,"Updated diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children: experts' consensus statement (condensed version of the second edition)","作者:Shen, KL (Shen, Kun-Ling)[ 1 ] ; Yang, YH (Yang, Yong-Hong)[ 1 ] ; Jiang, RM (Jiang, Rong-Meng)[ 2 ] ; Wang, TY (Wang, Tian-You)[ 3 ] ; Zhao, DC (Zhao, Dong-Chi)[ 4 ] ; Jiang, Y (Jiang, Yi)[ 5 ] ; Lu, XX (Lu, Xiao-Xia)[ 6 ] ; Jin, RM (Jin, Run-Ming)[ 7 ] ; Zheng, YJ (Zheng, Yue-Jie)[ 8 ] ; Xu, BP (Xu, Bao-Ping)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Pediatrics,,APR 2020,"Capital Med Univ, Beijing Childrens Hosp, China Natl Clin Res Ctr Resp Dis, Dept Resp Med,Natl Ctr Childrens Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the need to re-think the delivery of services to patients with chronic dysimmune neuropathies. Telephone/video consultations have become widespread but have compounded concerns about objective evaluation. Therapeutic decisions need, more than ever before, to be considered in the best interests of both patients, and society, while not denying function-preserving/restoring treatment. Immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange, for those treated outside of the home, expose patients to the hazards of hospital or outpatient infusion centers. Steroid therapy initiation and continuation pose increased infectious risk. Immunosuppressant therapy similarly becomes highly problematic, with the risks of treatment continuation enhanced by uncertainties regarding duration of the pandemic. The required processes necessitate considerable time and effort especially as resources and staff are re-deployed to face the pandemic, but are essential for protecting this group of patients and as an integral part of wider public health actions.",作者关键词:chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; COVID-19; dysimmune; multifocal motor neuropathy; pandemic; paraproteinemic neuropathy,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MUSCLE & NERVE,10.1002/mus.26896,Management challenges for chronic dysimmune neuropathies during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Rajabally, YA (Rajabally, Yusuf A.)[ 1,2 ] ; Goedee, HS (Goedee, H.

"摘要
Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.",,文献类型:Article,SCIENCE,10.1126/science.aba9757,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,"作者:Chinazzi, M (Chinazzi, Matteo)[ 1 ] ; Davis, JT (Davis, Jessica T.)[ 1 ] ; Ajelli, M (Ajelli, Marco)[ 2 ] ; Gioannini, C (Gioannini, Corrado)[ 3 ] ; Litvinova, M (Litvinova, Maria)[ 3 ] ; Merler, S (Merler, Stefano)[ 2 ] ; Piontti, APY (Pastore y Piontti, Ana)[ 1 ] ; Mu, KP (Mu, Kunpeng)[ 1 ] ; Rossi, L (Rossi, Luca)[ 3 ] ; Sun, KY (Sun, Kaiyuan)[ 4 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,EU H2020 MOOD project ,出版年: APR 24 2020,"Northeastern Univ, Lab Modeling Biol & Sociotech Syst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

"摘要
At present, there is scarce information regarding the global prevalence of chronic liver disease in individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, which is becoming a global pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the overall prevalence of chronic liver disease among patients with COVID-19 disease by meta-analysing data in observational studies and to investigate the relationship between liver damage and COVID-19 disease. We included 11 observational studies for a total of 2034 adult individuals (median age 49 years [IQR 45-54], 57.2% men). The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2%-4%; I-2 = 29.1%). Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus. Further studies are needed to better investigate the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 disease and the effect of treatment for COVID-19 on the liver.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,LIVER INTERNATIONAL,10.1111/liv.14465,Coronavirus disease 2019 and prevalence of chronic liver disease: A meta-analysis,"作者:Mantovani, A (Mantovani, Alessandro)[ 1,2 ] ; Beatrice, G (Beatrice, Giorgia)[ 1,2 ] ; Dalbeni, A (Dalbeni, Andrea)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Gastroenterology & Hepatology,,APR 2020,"Univ Verona, Dept Med, Sect Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Piazzale Stefani 1, I-37126 Verona, Italy.

"摘要
The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant global event in the history of infectious diseases. The SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from bats but is now easily transmissible among humans, primarily through droplet or direct contact. Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this. The primary laboratory findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and CRP levels may correlate with disease severity. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality. Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged. However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city. The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemic; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; WHO; CDC; Coronavirus; Pneumonia; Outbreak; Infection; Quarantine; Virus; Transmission; Clinical pathway,文献类型:Review; Early Access,CLINICAL REVIEWS IN ALLERGY & IMMUNOLOGY,10.1007/s12016-020-08792-8,Clinical Pathway for Early Diagnosis of COVID-19: Updates from Experience to Evidence-Based Practice,"作者:Xu, GG (Xu, Guogang)[ 1,2 ] ; Yang, YS (Yang, Yongshi)[ 3 ] ; Du, YZ (Du, Yingzhen)[ 1,2 ] ; Peng, FJ (Peng, Fujun)[ 4,5 ] ; Hu, P (Hu, Peng)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, RH (Wang, Runsheng)[ 1,2 ] ; Yin, M (Yin, Ming)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, TH (Li, Tianzhi)[ 1,2 ] ; Tu, L (Tu, Lei)[ 6 ] ; Sun, JY (Sun, Jinlyu)[ 3 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Allergy; Immunology,Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation General Program ,APR 2020,"Peking Union Med Coll & Chinese Acad Med Sci, Dept Allergy & Clin Immunol, Peking Union Med Coll Hosp, Natl Clin Res Ctr Immunol Dis, 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing Dongcheng Dist, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19), has caused a pandemic with >850,000 cases worldwide and increasing. Several studies report outcomes of COVID-19 in predominately well persons. There are also some data on COVID-19 in persons with predominately solid cancer but controversy whether these persons have the same outcomes. We conducted a cohort study at two centres in Wuhan, China, of 128 hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers, 13 (10%) of whom developed COVID-19. We also studied 226 health care providers, 16 of whom developed COVID-19 and 11 of whom were hospitalised. Co-variates were compared with the 115 subjects with haematological cancers without COVID-19 and with 11 hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. There were no significant differences in baseline co-variates between subjects with haematological cancers developing or not developing COVID-19. Case rates for COVID-19 in hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers was 10% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 6, 17%) compared with 7% (4, 12%; P = 0.322) in health care providers. However, the 13 subjects with haematological cancers had more severe COVID-19 and more deaths compared with hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. Case fatality rates were 62% (32, 85%) and 0 (0, 32%; P = 0.002). Hospitalised persons with haematological cancers have a similar case rate of COVID-19 compared with normal health care providers but have more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate. Because we were unable to identify specific risk factors for COVID-19 in hospitalised persons with haematological cancers, we suggest increased surveillance and possible protective isolation.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,LEUKEMIA,10.1038/s41375-020-0836-7,COVID-19 in persons with haematological cancers,"作者:He, WJ (He, Wenjuan)[ 1 ] ; Chen, L (Chen, Lei)[ 1 ] ; Chen, L (Chen, Li)[ 2 ] ; Yuan, GL (Yuan, Guolin)[ 3 ] ; Fang, Y (Fang, Yun)[ 1 ] ; Chen, WL (Chen, Wenlan)[ 1 ] ; Wu, D (Wu, Di)[ 1 ] ; Liang, B (Liang, Bo)[ 4 ] ; Lu, XT (Lu, Xiaoting)[ 4 ] ; Ma, YL (Ma, Yanling)[ 5 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Oncology; Hematology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Haematol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan 430022, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Healthcare providers are facing a coronavirus disease pandemic. This pandemic may last for many months, stressing the Canadian healthcare system in a way that has not previously been seen. Keeping healthcare providers safe, healthy, and available to work throughout this pandemic is critical. The consistent use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) will help assure its availability and healthcare provider safety. The purpose of this communique is to give both anesthesiologists and other front-line healthcare providers a framework from which to understand the principles and practices surrounding PPE decision-making. We propose three types of PPE including: 1) PPE for droplet and contact precautions, 2) PPE for general airborne, droplet, and contact precautions, and 3) PPE for those performing or assisting with high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedures.",作者关键词:COVID-19; personal protective equipment; coronavirus,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE,10.1007/s12630-020-01673-w,Personal protective equipment (PPE) for both anesthesiologists and other airway managers: principles and practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Lockhart, SL (Lockhart, Shannon L.)[ 1 ] ; Duggan, LV (Duggan, Laura, V)[ 2 ] ; Wax, RS (Wax, Randy S.)[ 3 ] ; Saad, S (Saad, Stephan)[ 4 ] ; Grocott, HP (Grocott, Hilary P.)[ 5 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology,,APR 2020,"Univ Ottawa, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

"摘要
The emergence of the strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and its impact on global health have made imperative the development of effective and safe vaccines for this lethal strain. SARS-CoV-2 now adds to the list of coronavirus diseases that have threatened global health, along with the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronaviruses that emerged in 2002/2003 and 2012, respectively. As of April 2020, no vaccine is commercially available for these coronavirus strains. Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from the vaccine development efforts for MERS and SARS can be of high value for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Here, we review the past and ongoing vaccine development efforts for clinically relevant coronavirus strains with the intention that this information helps in the development of effective and safe vaccines for COVID-19. In addition, information from naturally exposed individuals and animal models to coronavirus strains is described for the same purpose of helping into the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; SARS; Vaccine,文献类型:Review; Early Access,INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY,10.1007/s40121-020-00300-x,Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2: Lessons from Other Coronavirus Strains,"作者:Padron-Regalado, E (Padron-Regalado, Eriko)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,APR 2020,"Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford, Oxon, England.

"摘要
In 1973, IL-6 was identified as a soluble factor that is secreted by T cells and is important for antibody production by B cells. Since its discovery more than 40 years ago, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a pivotal pathway involved in immune regulation in health and dysregulation in many diseases. Targeting of the IL-6 pathway has led to innovative therapeutic approaches for various rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as other conditions such as Castleman disease and cytokine release syndrome. Targeting this pathway has also identified avenues for potential expansion into several other indications, such as uveitis, neuromyelitis optica and, most recently, COVID-19 pneumonia. To mark the tenth anniversary of anti-IL-6 receptor therapy worldwide, we discuss the history of research into IL-6 biology and the development of therapies that target IL-6 signalling, including the successes and challenges and with an emphasis on rheumatic diseases.

In this Perspective article, the authors recount the earliest stages of translational research into IL-6 biology and the subsequent development of therapeutic IL-6 pathway inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases and potentially numerous other indications.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE REVIEWS RHEUMATOLOGY,10.1038/s41584-020-0419-z,Translating IL-6 biology into effective treatments,"作者:Choy, EH (Choy, Ernest H.)[ 1 ] ; De Benedetti, F (De Benedetti, Fabrizio)[ 2,3 ] ; Takeuchi, T (Takeuchi, Tsutomu)[ 4 ] ; Hashizume, M (Hashizume, Misato)[ 5 ] ; John, MR (John, Markus R.)[ 6 ] ; Kishimoto, T (Kishimoto, Tadamitsu)[ 7 ]",研究方向:Rheumatology,,APR 2020,"Cardiff Univ, CREATE Ctr, Div Infect & Immun, Cardiff, England.

"摘要
To analyze the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and the drugs that can be used to treat pregnancy with COVID-19, so as to provide evidence for drug selection in clinic. By reviewing the existing literature, this paper analyzes the susceptibility of pregnant women to virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs. The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove. Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women. And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections. More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic. Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc. Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus. However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.",作者关键词:New coronavirus disease; Pregnancy; Virus susceptibility; Antiviral treatment; Fetal safety,文献类型:Review; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1007/s10096-020-03897-6,Analysis of the susceptibility to COVID-19 in pregnancy and recommendations on potential drug screening,"作者:Zhao, XX (Zhao, Xiaoxuan)[ 1 ] ; Jiang, YP (Jiang, Yuepeng)[ 2 ] ; Zhao, Y (Zhao, Yang)[ 3 ] ; Xi, HY (Xi, Hongyan)[ 1 ] ; Liu, C (Liu, Chang)[ 2 ] ; Qu, F (Qu, Fan)[ 4 ] ; Feng, XL (Feng, Xiaoling)[ 5 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Zhejiang Univ, Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Hangzhou 310006, Peoples R China.

Purpose There is an urgent need to address how to best provide ophthalmic care for patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents during the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection. Methods The Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance. Results The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring. Conclusion Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.",作者关键词:Retinal disease; Ophthalmology; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Recommendations; Vision Academy,文献类型:Review; Early Access,GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY,10.1007/s00417-020-04703-x,Guidance for anti-VEGF intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Korobelnik, JF (Korobelnik, Jean-Francois)[ 1,2 ] ; Loewenstein, A (Loewenstein, Anat)[ 3 ] ; Eldem, B (Eldem, Bora)[ 4 ] ; Joussen, AM (Joussen, Antonia M.)[ 5 ] ; Koh, A (Koh, Adrian)[ 6 ] ; Lambrou, GN (Lambrou, George N.)[ 7 ] ; Lanzetta, P (Lanzetta, Paolo)[ 8,9,10 ] ; Li, XX (Li, Xiaoxin)[ 11 ] ; Lovestam-Adrian, M (Lovestam-Adrian, Monica)[ 12 ] ; Navarro, R (Navarro, Rafael)[ 13 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Ophthalmology,"Bayer Consumer Care AG, Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland ",APR 2020,"CHU Bordeaux, Serv Ophtalmol, Bordeaux, France.

"摘要
The Covid-19 pandemic that swept through the world in late 2019 and through 2020 provides a test not just for all societies and their leadership, but for leadership theory. In a world turned upside down, when many conventions are disposed of, it is clear that things will not return to the status quo ante any time soon, if ever. In the light of these challenges, this short paper suggests we might reconsider the way governments and their leaders act against the frame of societal problems, originally established by Rittell and Webber in 1973. I suggest that all three modes of decision-making (Leadership, Management and Command) are necessary because of the complex and complicated nature of the problem and conclude that while Command is appropriate for certain times and issues, it also poses long-term threats, especially if the context is ignored.",作者关键词:Leadership; Management; Command; Coronavirus; role,文献类型:Article; Early Access,LEADERSHIP,UNSP 1742715020922445,"Leadership, Management and Command in the time of the Coronavirus","作者:Grint, K (Grint, Keith)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Business & Economics,,10.1177/1742715020922445,"Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Warwick, England.

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread across the world, placing unprecedented strain on the health care system. Health care resources including hospital beds, ICUs, as well as personal protective equipment are becoming increasingly rationed and scare commodities. In this environment, the laryngectomee (patient having previously undergone a total laryngectomy) continues to represent a unique patient with unique needs. Given their surgically altered airway, they pose a challenge to manage for the otolaryngologist within the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this brief report, we present special considerations and best practice recommendations in the management of total laryngectomy patients. We also discuss recommendations for laryngectomy patients and minimizing community exposures.",作者关键词:COVID-19; infection control; laryngectomy; otolaryngology-head and neck surgery; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26183,Commentary on the management of total laryngectomy patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Hennessy, M (Hennessy, Max)[ 1 ] ; Bann, DV (Bann, Darrin V.)[ 1 ] ; Patel, VA (Patel, Vijay A.)[ 1 ] ; Saadi, R (Saadi, Robert)[ 1 ] ; Krempl, GA (Krempl, Greg A.)[ 2 ] ; Deschler, DG (Deschler, Daniel G.)[ 3 ] ; Goyal, N (Goyal, Neerav)[ 1 ] ; Choi, KY (Choi, Karen Y.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 500 Univ Dr,H091, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.

Head and neck cancer patients with tracheostomies and laryngectomies, as well as their healthcare providers, face unique challenges in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This document consolidates best available evidence to date and presents recommendations to minimize the risks of aerosolization and SARS-CoV-2 exposures in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. The cornerstones of these recommendations include the use of closed-circuit ventilation whenever possible, cuffed tracheostomy tubes, judicious use of heat moisture exchange units, appropriate personal protective equipment for providers and patients, meticulous hand hygiene, and minimal manipulation of tracheostomy tubes.",作者关键词:Aerosolization; COVID-19; Laryngectomy; SARS-CoV-2; Tracheostomy,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26171,Managing head and neck cancer patients with tracheostomy or laryngectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Kligerman, MP (Kligerman, Maxwell P.)[ 1,2 ] ; Vukkadala, N (Vukkadala, Neelaysh)[ 1,2 ] ; Tsang, RKY (Tsang, Raymond K.

There have been three major global outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus in the last two decades. The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, is the most dangerous, which spread to 163 countries and 6 continents and caused a major public health emergency worldwide. The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human. As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%. There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important. In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures. We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.",作者关键词:COVID-19; sars-CoV-2; epidemiology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH,10.1080/09603123.2020.1747602,Coronavirus disease 2019: reassembly attack of coronavirus,"作者:Yang, CL (Yang, Chenglei)[ 1 ] ; Qiu, X (Qiu, Xue)[ 2 ] ; Fan, HR (Fan, Haoran)[ 2 ] ; Jiang, M (Jiang, Mei)[ 2 ] ; Lao, XJ (Lao, Xiaojie)[ 3 ] ; Zeng, YK (Zeng, Yukeng)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, ZM (Zhang, Zhiming)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,APR 2020,"71 Hedi Rd,Bldg 106, Nanning 530021, Guangxi, Peoples R China.

Persons with disabilities (PWDs) living in cities during the COVID-19 pandemic response may be four times more likely to be injured or die than non-disabled persons, not because of their ""vulnerable"" position but because urban health policy, planning and practice has not considered their needs. In this article, the adverse health impacts on PWDs during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the ""everyday emergencies"" in cities for PWDs and that these can be avoided through more inclusive community planning, a whole-of-government commitment to equal access, and implementation of universal design strategies. Importantly, COVID-19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses, such as social distancing, can lead to life-threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home heath or personal assistants. Living in cities may already present health-damaging challenges for PWDs, such as through lack of access to services and employment, physical barriers on streets and transportation, and smart-city technologies that are not made universally accessible. We suggest that the current pandemic be viewed as an opportunity for significant urban health reforms on the scale of the sanitary and governance reforms that followed ninetieth century urban epidemics. This perspective offers insights for ensuring the twenty-first century response to COVID-19 focuses on promoting more inclusive and healthy cities for all.",作者关键词:COVID-19 pandemic; Climate change; Persons with disabilities; Health equity,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11524-020-00437-7,"Disability, Urban Health Equity, and the Coronavirus Pandemic: Promoting Cities for All","作者:Pineda, VS (Pineda, Victor Santiago)[ 1 ] ; Corburn, J (Corburn, Jason)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine",,APR 2020,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth & City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

As cases of COVID-19 were rising in India and the country's political leadership instituted a nationwide lockdown, one of the authors of this article received a timely invitation from a friend - a government official - to make rounds with him and his team to various neighbourhoods within the metropolitan city of Bangalore. The team consisted of members working in healthcare, municipal corporation, and local police, and was tasked with ensuring that the government enacted measures of social distancing were being observed by local residents in public spaces. The author witnessed, in real time, the ways in which residents were engaging with the containment measures that were instituted as part of the political leadership's attempt to flatten the curve of COVID-19. What was observed in an urban slum was particularly poignant and illuminating. The observations captured how, for residents of the urban slum, social distancing is more an aspiration than an attainable reality. Indeed, social distancing is impossible if such a protocol does not come with concomitant economic support targeted to the most socially vulnerable in society.",作者关键词:COVID-19; India; social distancing; urban slums,文献类型:Article; Early Access,LOCAL ENVIRONMENT,10.1080/13549839.2020.1754375,The impossibility of social distancing among the urban poor: the case of an Indian slum in the times of COVID-19,"作者:Wasdani, KP (Wasdani, Kishinchand Poornima)[ 1 ] ; Prasad, A (Prasad, Ajnesh)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellowship - MITACS, Canada ",APR 2020,"Royal Rd Univ, Sch Business, 2005 Sooke Rd, Victoria, BC V9B 5Y2, Canada.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate that our focus is on patient care and preparation. However, the genetics community is well poised to fill in the educational gap created by medical students transitioning to limiting patient contact, creation of telemedicine patient care, and online learning modules. Our history of agility in learning and teaching is now only inhibited by the time constraints of current clinical demands on the genetics community. This publication is designed to offer ideas and resources for quickly transitioning our education to meet the current demands in the time of a pandemic. Not only will this allow us to continue our strong history of education, it will enhance our strong commitment to using modern educational techniques and tools to address the genetics workforce issues that have defined the recent past. We have the opportunity to aggressively educate for trainees that now have the capacity to learn, and to lead the way in showing how the genetics community rallies together no matter the challenge.",作者关键词:Genetics education; Telemedicine education; Communities of practice,文献类型:Article; Early Access,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A,10.1002/ajmg.a.61595,Medical genetics education in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: Shared resources,"作者:Regier, DS (Regier, Debra S.)[ 1 ] ; Smith, WE (Smith, Wendy E.)[ 2 ] ; Byers, HM (Byers, Heather M.)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Genetics & Heredity,,APR 2020,"Natl Childrens Hosp, Washington, DC 20010 USA.

Introduction The recent appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan in 2019 has started a pandemic which has involved over a million people worldwide. A matter of debate is the possible viral detection in different body fluids than respiratory droplets. Thus, we evaluated the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with confirmed COVID-19. Materials and methods A 31-year-old man with fever, myalgia, anosmia, and ageusia was tested and found positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a pharyngeal swab. Eight days after he provided semen and urine samples in which viral RNA presence was measured using a Real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting E and S viral genes. Results and discussion Semen and urine samples search for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. Although this should be interpreted cautiously, it may be possible that either the viral clearance kinetics in these matrices matches the progressive clinical recovery of the patient or that the virus was never present in these fluids at the time of the laboratory diagnosis.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; Semen fluid; Pharyngeal swab; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION,10.1007/s40618-020-01261-1,Study of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with positive naso-pharyngeal swab,"作者:Paoli, D (Paoli, D.)[ 1 ] ; Pallotti, F (Pallotti, F.)[ 1 ] ; Colangelo, S (Colangelo, S.)[ 1 ] ; Basilico, F (Basilico, F.)[ 2 ] ; Mazzuti, L (Mazzuti, L.)[ 3 ] ; Turriziani, O (Turriziani, O.)[ 3 ] ; Antonelli, G (Antonelli, G.)[ 3 ] ; Lenzi, A (Lenzi, A.)[ 1 ] ; Lombardo, F (Lombardo, F.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Endocrinology & Metabolism,,APR 2020,"Sapienza Univ Rome, Lab Seminol Sperm Bank Loredana Gandini, Dept Expt Med, Viale Policlin 155, I-00161 Rome, Italy.

"摘要
Detailed clinical and virologic characteristics of the first 12 individuals with COVID-19 in the United States from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Data on the detailed clinical progression of COVID-19 in conjunction with epidemiological and virological characteristics are limited. In this case series, we describe the first 12 US patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 20 January to 5 February 2020, including 4 patients described previously(1-3). Respiratory, stool, serum and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, viral culture and whole genome sequencing. Median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 patients were male. Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE MEDICINE,10.1038/s41591-020-0877-5,Clinical and virologic characteristics of the first 12 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States,团体作者: COVID 19 Investigation,研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,APR 2020,
"摘要
We investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism by surveying expression of viral entry-associated genes in single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple tissues from healthy human donors. We co-detected these transcripts in specific respiratory, corneal and intestinal epithelial cells, potentially explaining the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These genes are co-expressed in nasal epithelial cells with genes involved in innate immunity, highlighting the cells' potential role in initial viral infection, spread and clearance. The study offers a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and we provide our data in a comprehensive, open and user-friendly fashion at www.covid19cellatlas.org.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE MEDICINE,10.1038/s41591-020-0868-6,SARS-CoV-2 entry factors are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells together with innate immune genes,"作者:Sungnak, W (Sungnak, Waradon)[ 1 ] ; Huang, N (Huang, Ni)[ 1 ] ; Becavin, C (Becavin, Christophe)[ 2 ] ; Berg, M (Berg, Marijn)[ 3,4,5 ] ; Queen, R (Queen, Rachel)[ 6 ] ; Litvinukova, M (Litvinukova, Monika)[ 1,7 ] ; Talavera-Lopez, C (Talavera-Lopez, Carlos)[ 1 ] ; Maatz, H (Maatz, Henrike)[ 7 ] ; Reichart, D (Reichart, Daniel)[ 8 ] ; Sampaziotis, F (Sampaziotis, Fotios)[ 9,10,11 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Wellcome Sanger Institute ,APR 2020,"Wellcome Sanger Inst, Cambridge, England.

"摘要
Objectives To investigate the different CT characteristics which may distinguish influenza from 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods A total of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from January 16, 2020, to February 25, 2020. Furthermore, 92 CT scans of confirmed patients with influenza pneumonia, including 76 with influenza A and 16 with influenza B, scanned between January 1, 2019, to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Pulmonary lesion distributions, number, attenuation, lobe predomination, margin, contour, ground-glass opacity involvement pattern, bronchial wall thickening, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion were evaluated in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia cohorts. Results Peripheral and non-specific distributions in COVID-19 showed a markedly higher frequency compared with the influenza group (p < 0.05). Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p < 0.05). COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). The lesion number and attenuation, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular septal thickening were not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.05). Conclusions Though viral pneumonias generally show similar imaging features, there are some characteristic CT findings which may help differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Influenza; Pneumonia; Virus; Tomography; X-ray,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00330-020-06880-z,Characteristic CT findings distinguishing 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from influenza pneumonia,"作者:Wang, H (Wang, Hao)[ 1 ] ; Wei, R (Wei, Ran)[ 1 ] ; Rao, GH (Rao, Guihua)[ 2 ] ; Zhu, J (Zhu, Jie)[ 1 ] ; Song, B (Song, Bin)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,APR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Minhang Hosp, Dept Radiol, 170 Xinsong Rd, Shanghai 201199, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Radiographic patterns on CT chest scans have shown higher sensitivity and specificity compared to RT-PCR detection of COVID-19 which, according to the WHO has a relatively low positive detection rate in the early stages. We technically review a study that compared multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify CT samples with COVID-19, Influenza viral pneumonia, or no-infection. We compare this mentioned study with one that is developed on existing 2D and 3D deep-learning models, combining them with the latest clinical understanding, and achieved an AUC of 0.996 (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies. They calculated a sensitivity of 98.2% and a specificity of 92.2%.",作者关键词:Pandemic; Viral pneumonias; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learing,文献类型:Article; Early Access,APPLIED INTELLIGENCE,10.1007/s10489-020-01714-3,Deep learning system to screen coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia,"作者:Butt, C (Butt, Charmaine)[ 1 ] ; Gill, J (Gill, Jagpal)[ 1 ] ; Chun, D (Chun, David)[ 2 ] ; Babu, BA (Babu, Benson A.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Computer Science,,APR 2020,"St Johns Episcopal Hosp, New York, NY 11691 USA.

"摘要
At the beginning of the 21st century, a new deadly infectious disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recognized as a global public health threat. Subsequently, ten years after the initial SARS cases occurred in 2002, new cases of another atypical respiratory disease caused worldwide concern. This disease became known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and was even more lethal than SARS. Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019. For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent. In sum, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by recently discovered coronaviruses that cause flu-like illnesses, but with a clinical outcome that tends to be more severe. As a result of the current importance of coronaviruses in global public health, we conducted a review to summarize and update, above all, the epidemiological historical aspects of the three major diseases in humans caused by coronaviral infection.",,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY,10.1007/s00705-020-04628-0,"The emergence of SARS, MERS and novel SARS-2 coronaviruses in the 21st century","作者:da Costa, VG (da Costa, Vivaldo Gomes)[ 1 ] ; Moreli, ML (Moreli, Marcos Lazaro)[ 2 ] ; Saivish, MV (Saivish, Marielena Vogel)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Virology,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),APR 2020,"Univ Brasilia, Dept Cellular Biol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.

"摘要
In this contribution, I discuss potential risk to the health of people with disabilities in residential care institutions during the COVID-19 outbreak by looking at evidence from Romania. As an academic who has studied deinstitutionalization of services for people with disabilities in Romania, I argue that residential care institutions for people with disabilities are at risk of becoming sites for community contagion with COVID-19. These institutions are often located in remote and economically peripheral areas of the country that have been characterized by high rates of outmigration. Now, these are becoming areas of intense return migration. Community contagion in adjacent locations can easily spill over to residential institutions through care and health workers' trajectories. Once spread to residential institutions, COVID-19 has a high chance of adversely affecting the health of residents with disabilities. It is vital to ensure disabled people's health and wellbeing through adequate contagion prevention measures.",作者关键词:right to health; COVID-19; residential institutions; migration; Romania; disability,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DISABILITY & SOCIETY,10.1080/09687599.2020.1754766,Challenges posed by COVID-19 to the health of people with disabilities living in residential care facilities in Romania,"作者:Safta-Zecheria, L (Safta-Zecheria, Leyla)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Rehabilitation; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,APR 2020,"West Univ, Educ Sci Dept, Timisoara, Romania.

Purpose The role of tracheostomy in COVID-19-related ARDS is unknown. Nowadays, there is no clear indication regarding the timing of tracheostomy in these patients. Methods We describe our synergic experience between ENT and ICU Departments at University Hospital of Modena underlining some controversial aspects that would be worth discussing tracheostomies in these patients. During the last 2 weeks, we performed 28 tracheostomies on patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection who were treated with IMV. Results No differences between percutaneous and surgical tracheostomy in terms of timing and no case of team virus infection.

Background/objectives To evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition and its related factors in elderly patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Subjects/methods In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the nutritional status of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA >= 24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17-23.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score < 17). Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition. Results A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7% were in the malnutrition group. There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups. Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition. Conclusions The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION,10.1038/s41430-020-0642-3,"Prevalence of malnutrition and analysis of related factors in elderly patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","作者:Li, T (Li, Tao)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, YL (Zhang, Yalan)[ 1 ] ; Gong, C (Gong, Cheng)[ 1 ] ; Wang, J (Wang, Jing)[ 1 ] ; Liu, B (Liu, Bao)[ 1 ] ; Shi, L (Shi, Li)[ 1 ] ; Duan, J (Duan, Jun)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Nutrition & Dietetics,,APR 2020,"China Japan Friendship Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a surge of patients that exceeds available human and physical resources in many settings, triggering the implementation of crisis standards of care. High-quality respiratory protection is essential to reduce exposure among healthcare workers, yet dire shortages of personal protective equipment in the United States threaten the health and safety of this essential workforce. In the context of rapidly changing conditions and incomplete data, this article outlines 3 important strategies to improve healthcare workers' respiratory protection. At a minimum, healthcare workers delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear N95 respirators and full-face shields. Several mechanisms exist to boost and protect the supply of N95 respirators, including rigorous decontamination protocols, invoking the Defense Production Act, expanded use of reusable elastomeric respirators, and repurposing industrial N95 respirators. Finally, homemade facial coverings do not protect healthcare workers and should be avoided. These strategies, coupled with longer-term strategies of investments in protective equipment research, infrastructure, and data systems, provide a framework to protect healthcare workers immediately and enhance preparedness efforts for future pandemics.",作者关键词:Personal protective equipment; Healthcare workers; COVID-19,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,HEALTH SECURITY,10.1089/hs.2020.0036,Respiratory Protection Considerations for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"作者:Friese, CR (Friese, Christopher R.)[ 1 ] ; Veenema, TG (Veenema, Tener Goodwin)[ 2,3 ] ; Johnson, JS (Johnson, James S.)[ 4 ] ; Jayaraman, S (Jayaraman, Sundaresan)[ 5 ] ; Chang, JC (Chang, James C.)[ 6 ] ; Clever, LH (Clever, Linda Hawes)[ 7 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","United States Department of Health & Human Services

This paper reflects on how risk science, with its concepts, principles, approaches, methods and models, can support the actual assessments, communication and handling of the vulnerabilities and risks related to the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. We highlight the importance of acknowledging uncertainty as a main component of risk, in order to properly characterize and communicate risk, as well as to understand the difference between professional risk judgements and risk perception. We challenge the use of the commonly referred to phrase that the policies adopted are science-based, in a situation like this characterized by fundamental uncertainties about the underlying phenomena and the effects of possible interventions. Arguments are provided for a 'balanced' use of precaution, combined with adaptive management and learning.",作者关键词:COVID-19; risk science; risk analysis; risk communication,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH,10.1080/13669877.2020.1756383,The COVID-19 pandemic: how can risk science help?,"作者:Aven, T (Aven, Terje)[ 1 ] ; Bouder, F (Bouder, Frederic)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics,,APR 2020,"Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway.

At the end of March 2020, international media present Swedish management of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic as soft and irresponsible. Thus, Sweden, which is usually regarded as exceptionally risk averse and cautious, has chosen an unexpected risk management approach. The aim of this article is to reflect on how the Swedish government has managed the Covid-19 pandemic until early April 2020 from two theoretical perspectives, the risk society thesis and governmentality theory. We make a brief review of how previous pandemics have been managed compared to Covid-19 and try to understand the consequences of the Swedish handling of present pandemic with a particular focus on the governance of the pandemic and the exercise of power rather than definite risk management strategies during the pandemic.",作者关键词:Covid-19; risk society; inequality; governing of conduct; individual responsibilisation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH,10.1080/13669877.2020.1756382,Managing the Covid-19 pandemic through individual responsibility: the consequences of a world risk society and enhanced ethopolitics,"作者:Nygren, KG (Giritli Nygren, Katarina)[ 1 ] ; Olofsson, A (Olofsson, Anna)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics,,APR 2020,"Mid Sweden Univ, Risk & Crisis Res Ctr, Ostersund, Sweden.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency rooms are faced with major challenges because they act as the interface between outpatient and inpatient care. The dynamics of the pandemic forced emergency care at the University Hospital Munster to extensively adjust their processes, which had to be carried out in the shortest time possible. This included the establishment of an outpatient coronavirus test center and a medical student-operated telephone hotline. Inside the hospital, new isolation capacities in the emergency room and a dedicated COVID-19 ward were set up. The patient flow was reorganized using flow diagrams for both the outpatient and inpatient areas. The general and special emergency management was optimized for the efficient treatment of COVID-19-positive patients and the staff were trained in the use of protective equipment. This report of our experience is intended to support other emergency departments in their preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Emergency room; Sars-CoV-2; Throat-swab; Patient allocation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK-INTENSIVMEDIZIN UND NOTFALLMEDIZIN,10.1007/s00063-020-00693-0,Handling of COVID-19 in the emergency department Field report of the emergency ward of the University Hospital Munster,"作者:Wennmann, DO (Wennmann, D.

The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 has impacted many lives and affects the whole healthcare systems globally. In addition to the considerable workload challenges, surgeons are faced with a number of uncertainties regarding their own safety, practice, and overall patient care. This guide has been drafted at short notice to advise on specific issues related to surgical service provision and the safety of minimally invasive surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although laparoscopy can theoretically lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, there is no evidence available to confirm this is the case with COVID-19. The ultimate decision on the approach should be made after considering the proven benefits of laparoscopic techniques versus the potential theoretical risks of aerosolization. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties and all members of the OR staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status. Pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open. All emergent endoscopic procedures performed during the pandemic should be considered as high risk and PPE must be used by all endoscopy staff.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Surgery; Laparoscopy,文献类型:Article; Early Access,SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES,10.1007/s00464-020-07565-w,SAGES and EAES recommendations for minimally invasive surgery during COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Francis, N (Francis, Nader)[ 1,2 ] ; Dort, J (Dort, Jonathan)[ 3 ] ; Cho, E (Cho, Eugene)[ 4 ] ; Feldman, L (Feldman, Liane)[ 5 ] ; Keller, D (Keller, Deborah)[ 6 ] ; Lim, R (Lim, Rob)[ 7 ] ; Mikami, D (Mikami, Dean)[ 8 ] ; Phillips, E (Phillips, Edward)[ 9 ] ; Spaniolas, K (Spaniolas, Konstantinos)[ 10 ] ; Tsuda, S (Tsuda, Shawn)[ 11 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Surgery,,APR 2020,"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Surg, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2020 has the potential to transform the tourism industry as well as the context in which it operates. This global crisis in which travel, tourism, hospitality and events have been shut down in many parts of the world, provides an opportunity to uncover the possibilities in this historic transformative moment. A critical tourism analysis of these events briefly uncovers the ways in which tourism has supported neoliberal injustices and exploitation. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis may offer a rare and invaluable opportunity to rethink and reset tourism toward a better pathway for the future. 'Responsible' approaches to tourism alone, however, will not offer sufficient capacity to enable such a reset. Instead, such a vision requires a community-centred tourism framework that redefines and reorients tourism based on the rights and interests of local communities and local peoples. Theoretically, such an approach includes a way tourism could be 'socialised' by being recentred on the public good. This is essential for tourism to be made accountable to social and ecological limits of the planet.",作者关键词:COVID-19; responsible tourism; critical tourism; social tourism; social justice; public good tourism; cruiseship industry,文献类型:Article; Early Access,TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES,10.1080/14616688.2020.1757748,Socialising tourism for social and ecological justice after COVID-19,"作者:Higgins-Desbiolles, F (Higgins-Desbiolles, Freya)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics,,APR 2020,"Univ South Australia, Business Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

In the early months of the COVID-19 epidemic, some have wondered if the force of this global experience will solve the problem of vaccine refusal that has vexed and preoccupied the global public health community for the last several decades. Drawing on historical and epidemiological analyses, we critique contemporary approaches to reducing vaccine hesitancy and articulate our notion of vaccine confidence as an expanded way of conceptualizing the problem and how to respond to it. Intervening on the rush of vaccine optimism we see pervading present discourse around the COVID-19 epidemic, we call for a re-imagination of the culture of public health and the meaning of vaccine safety regulations. Public confidence in vaccination programs depends on the work they do for the community-social, political, and moral as well as biological. The concept of public health and its programs must be broader than the delivery of the vaccine technology itself. The narrative work and policy actions entailed in actualizing such changes will, we expect, be essential in achieving a true vaccine confidence, however the public reacts to the specific vaccine that may be developed for COVID-19.",作者关键词:Vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine confidence; COVID-19; Vaccine safety regulation; Culture; Historical,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,10.1007/s10654-020-00634-3,Vaccine confidence in the time of COVID-19,"作者:Harrison, EA (Harrison, Emily A.)[ 1,2 ] ; Wu, JW (Wu, Julia W.)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,APR 2020,"Harvard Univ, Dept Epidemiol, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

People are facing uncertain and difficult times in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. The benefits of plants (psychological, health, economic, productive) in this period of forced isolation can be of key importance. If many of us have to self-isolate in urban or suburban environments, we need something to do to keep our bodies and minds active and fed. In such a challenging scenario, a vegetable garden in home spaces can bring recreational, health, economic and environmental benefits. Regardless of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is untapped potential for this kind of garden to impact environmental outcomes, public awareness, and market trends. Home vegetable gardens could provide a small-scale approach to the sustainable use of natural resources, leading towards self-sufficiency, self-regulation, sustainability, and environmental protection.",作者关键词:Covid-19 pandemic; Mediterranean climate; Mental and physical well-being; Home spaces; Plant benefits; Vegetable garden,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HUMAN ECOLOGY,10.1007/s10745-020-00150-8,Converting Home Spaces Into Food Gardens At the Time of Covid-19 Quarantine: All the Benefits of Plants in This Difficult and Unprecedented Period,"作者:Sofo, A (Sofo, Adriano)[ 1 ] ; Sofo, A (Sofo, Antonino)",研究方向:Anthropology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Sociology,,APR 2020,"Univ Basilicata, Dept European & Mediterranean Cultures Architectu, Via Lanera 20, I-75100 Matera, Italy.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has recently spread globally and is now a pandemic. As a result, university hospitals have had to take unprecedented measures of containment, including asking nonessential staff to stay at home. Medical students practicing in the surgical departments find themselves idle, as nonurgent surgical activity has been canceled, until further notice. Likewise, universities are closed and medical training for students is likely to suffer if teachers do not implement urgent measures to provide continuing education. Thus, we sought to set up a daily medical education procedure for surgical students confined to their homes. We report a simple and free teaching method intended to compensate for the disappearance of daily lessons performed in the surgery department using the Google Hangouts application. This video conference method can be applied to clinical as well as anatomy lessons.",作者关键词:anatomical learning; anatomy; COVID-19 pandemic; medical education,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CLINICAL ANATOMY,10.1002/ca.23601,Daily medical education for confined students during COVID-19 pandemic: A simple videoconference solution,"作者:Moszkowicz, D (Moszkowicz, David)[ 1 ] ; Duboc, H (Duboc, Henri)[ 2 ] ; Dubertret, C (Dubertret, Caroline)[ 3 ] ; Roux, D (Roux, Damien)[ 4 ] ; Bretagnol, F (Bretagnol, Frederic)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Anatomy & Morphology,,APR 2020,"Univ Paris, Louis Mourier Hosp, AP HP, DMU ESPRIT,GHU,Dept Digest Surg, 178 Rue Renouillers, F-92700 Paris, France.

"摘要
From its beginning in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has spread globally from Wuhan and is now declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The sheer scale and severity of this pandemic is unprecedented in the modern era. Although primarily a respiratory tract infection transmitted by direct contact and droplets, during aerosol-generating procedures, there is a possibility of airborne transmission. In addition, emerging evidence suggests possible fecal-oral spread of the virus. Clinical departments that perform endoscopy are faced with daunting challenges during this pandemic. To date, multiple position statements and guidelines have been issued by various professional organizations to recommend practices in endoscopic procedures. This article aims to summarize and discuss available evidence for these practices, to provide guidance for endoscopy to enhance patient safety, avoid nosocomial outbreaks, protect healthcare personnel, and ensure rational use of personal protective equipment. Responses adapted to national recommendations and local infection control guidelines and tailored to the availability of medical resources are imminently needed to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Endoscopy; Infection prevention and control; Pandemic; Personal protective equipment; PPE; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY,10.1111/jgh.15053,Overview of guidance for endoscopy during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,"作者:Lui, RN (Lui, Rashid N.)[ 1,2 ] ; Wong, SH (Wong, Sunny H.)[ 1,2 ] ; Sanchez-Luna, SA (Sanchez-Luna, Sergio A.)[ 4 ] ; Pellino, G (Pellino, Gianluca)[ 5,6 ] ; Bollipo, S (Bollipo, Steven)[ 7 ] ; Wong, MY (Wong, Mei-Yin)[ 1,3 ] ; Chiu, PWY (Chiu, Philip W.

Even though the global COVID-19 pandemic may affect how medical care is delivered in general, most countries try to maintain steady access for women to routine pregnancy care, including fetal anomaly screening. This means that, also during this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place. For patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 will add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly. Yet, also for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system.",,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS,10.1002/pd.5702,SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection: is fetal surgery in times of national disasters reasonable?,"作者:Deprest, J (Deprest, Jan)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Van Ranst, M (Van Ranst, Marc)[ 5,6 ] ; Lannoo, L (Lannoo, Lore)[ 1,2 ] ; Bredaki, E (Bredaki, Emma)[ 3,4 ] ; Ryan, G (Ryan, Greg)[ 7,8,9 ] ; David, A (David, Anna)[ 3,4 ] ; Richter, J (Richter, Jute)[ 1,2 ] ; Van Mieghem, T (Van Mieghem, Tim)[ 7,8,9 ]",研究方向:Genetics & Heredity; Obstetrics & Gynecology,,APR 2020,"Dienst Gynaecol Verloskunde, Herestr 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.

"摘要
We measure readiness to face emergency expenses using data from a representative survey of U.S. consumers. Our main findings are as follows: (1) there is substantial heterogeneity in financial readiness, with lowest-income, least-educated, unemployed, and Black consumers most likely to have $0 saved for emergency expenses; (2) the amount of emergency savings is correlated with payment choice: Less financially prepared individuals use cash more and credit cards less, compared to those with higher emergency savings; (3) while people with low emergency savings rely more on cash than credit cards, they revolve more debt, and so a financial shock is costlier for them; (4) changes in income from one year to the next do not appear to affect the likelihood of revolving on credit cards or increase the amount borrowed, although the data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. For those with little or no savings and already financially vulnerable, even a temporary financial shock-an unexpected negative income shock (such as a layoff or a short-term government shutdown) or an unexpected expenditure (such as a medical expense or a car repair)-could have severe financial consequences, exacerbated by the high cost of borrowing on credit cards.

Background and Methods There is an added level of complexity in the management of head and neck cancer patients with underlying immunosuppressive disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Head and neck oncologists are tasked with balancing the dual risks of cancer progression in the setting of impaired tumor immunity and increased susceptibility to life-threatening complications from exposure to viral infection for patients and providers. Through two cases of immunocompromised patients with newly diagnosed head and neck malignancies, we aim to provide guidance to clinicians struggling with how to best counsel and manage this unique subset of patients under these difficult circumstances.

Results After careful consideration of the options, we took different approaches in the care of these two patients.

Conclusions Ultimately, there is no uniform set of rules to apply to this heterogeneous group of immunocompromised patients. We provide some general principles to help guide patient management during the current pandemic.",作者关键词:airway; COVID-19; head and neck cancer; immunosuppression; risk management,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26165,Care of immunocompromised patients with head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: Two challenging and informative clinical cases,"作者:Civantos, AM (Civantos, Alyssa M.)[ 1 ] ; Carey, RM (Carey, Ryan M.)[ 2 ] ; Lichtenstein, GR (Lichtenstein, Gary R.)[ 3 ] ; Lukens, JN (Lukens, John N.)[ 4 ] ; Cohen, RB (Cohen, Roger B.)[ 5 ] ; Rassekh, CH (Rassekh, Christopher H.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 3400 Spruce St,5th Floor,Ravdin Bldg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

"摘要
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients need to be evaluated within 2-4 weeks in the following cases: cytology result of ""squamous cell carcinoma,"" ""atypical glandular cells, favor neoplastic,"" ""endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ,"" or ""adenocarcinoma""; histopathological diagnosis of suspected invasion from cervical/vaginal biopsy, or invasive disease after a cervical excision procedure, vaginal excision, or vulvar biopsy/excision; sudden onset of strongly suggestive symptoms for malignancy. Digital imaging technologies represent an important opportunity during the COVID-19 pandemic to share colposcopic images with reference centers, with the aim of avoiding any concentration of patients. All patients must undergo screening for COVID-19 exposure and should wear a surgical mask. A high-efficiency filter smoke evacuation system is mandatory to remove surgical smoke. Electrosurgical instruments should be set at the lowest possible power and not be used for long continuous periods to reduce the amount of surgical smoke. The following personal protective equipment should be used: sterile fluid-repellant surgical gloves, an underlying pair of gloves, eye protection, FFP3 mask, surgical cap, and gown. The colposcope should be protected by a disposable transparent cover. A protective lens that must be disinfected after each use should be applied. The use of a video colposcope should be preferred.",作者关键词:Cervical cancer screening; Cervical excision; Colposcopy; Coronavirus; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS,10.1002/ijgo.13158,Expert consensus from the Italian Society for Colposcopy and Cervico-Vaginal Pathology (SICPCV) for colposcopy and outpatient surgery of the lower genital tract during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Ciavattini, A (Ciavattini, Andrea)[ 1 ] ; Delli Carpini, G (Delli Carpini, Giovanni)[ 1 ] ; Giannella, L (Giannella, Luca)[ 1 ] ; De Vincenzo, R (De Vincenzo, Rosa)[ 2,3 ] ; Frega, A (Frega, Antonio)[ 4 ] ; Cattani, P (Cattani, Paolo)[ 5 ] ; Boselli, F (Boselli, Fausto)[ 6 ] ; Sopracordevole, F (Sopracordevole, Francesco)[ 7 ] ; Barbero, M (Barbero, Maggiorino)[ 8,9 ]",研究方向:Obstetrics & Gynecology,,APR 2020,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Odontostomatol & Specialized Clin Sci, Ancona, Italy.

"摘要
Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to the global health care system. Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance.

Objective: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China.

Methods: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices.

Results: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation.

Conclusions: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies. The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated.",作者关键词:COVID-19; cloud system; syndromic surveillance; clinical decision support; stakeholders involvement; pandemic; medical informatics,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,e18948,"Cloud-Based System for Effective Surveillance and Control of COVID-19: Useful Experiences From Hubei, China","作者:Gong, MC (Gong, Mengchun)[ 1 ] ; Liu, L (Liu, Li)[ 2 ] ; Sun, X (Sun, Xin)[ 3 ] ; Yang, Y (Yang, Yue)[ 2 ] ; Wang, S (Wang, Shuang)[ 4 ] ; Zhu, H (Zhu, Hong)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Digital China Health Technologies co ltd ,出版年: APR 22 2020,"Southern Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, North 1838,Guangzhou Ave, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

"摘要
COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China and is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV 2. It has now spread rapidly to over 190 countries and territories around the world and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The virus is spread through droplet transmission and currently has a mortality rate of over 4% globally. The pediatric population has been found to be less susceptible to the disease with the majority of children having milder symptoms and only one pediatric death being reported globally so far. Despite this, strategies need to be put in place to prevent further spread of the virus. We present a summary of the general measures implemented at a large adult and pediatric tertiary hospital in Singapore (National University Hospital) as well as the specific strategies in place for the operating room and pediatric intensive care unit.",作者关键词:COVID-19; general anesthesia; pediatric; PICU; SARS-CoV 2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA,10.1111/pan.13863,Special considerations for the management of COVID-19 pediatric patients in the operating room and pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary hospital in Singapore,"作者:Thampi, S (Thampi, Swapna)[ 1,2 ] ; Yap, A (Yap, Andrea)[ 1,2 ] ; Fan, LJ (Fan, Lijia)[ 3,4 ] ; Ong, J (Ong, Jacqueline)[ 3,4 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology; Pediatrics,,APR 2020,"Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Anesthesia, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119074, Singapore.

"摘要
The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia. In northern Italy in particular, we rapidly experienced a critical care crisis due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as we expected according to data reported in China. Based on our experience of managing this surge, we produced this review to support other healthcare services in preparedness and training of hospitals during the current coronavirus outbreak. We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care units for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated intensive care unit, in personal protective equipment usage and patient management. Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad hoc training. Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented. Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required the multidisciplinary, multi-level involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety. Hospitals should be prepared to face severe disruptions to their routine and it is very likely that protocols and procedures might require re-discussion and updating on a daily basis.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; hospital preparedness; respiratory failure; surge capacity,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15072,Hospital surge capacity in a tertiary emergency referral centre during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy,"作者:Carenzo, L (Carenzo, L.)[ 1 ] ; Costantini, E (Costantini, E.)[ 1 ] ; Greco, M (Greco, M.)[ 4 ] ; Barra, FL (Barra, F.

"摘要
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has presented the world and physicians with a unique public health challenge. In light of its high transmissibility and large burden on the health care system, many hospitals and practices have opted to cancel elective surgeries in order to mobilize resources, ration personal protective equipment and guard patients from the virus. Head and neck cancer physicians are particularly affected by these changes given their scope of practice, complex patient population, and interventional focus. In this viewpoint, we discuss some of the many challenges faced by head and neck surgeons in this climate. Additionally, we outline the utility of telemedicine as a potential strategy for allowing physicians to maintain an effective continuum of care.",作者关键词:COVID-19; head and neck oncology; health systems; patient-physician communication; telemedicine,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26174,Head and neck virtual medicine in a pandemic era: Lessons from COVID-19,"作者:Prasad, A (Prasad, Aman)[ 1 ] ; Carey, RM (Carey, Ryan M.)[ 2 ] ; Rajasekaran, K (Rajasekaran, Karthik)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 800 Walnut St,18th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.

Background This case highlights challenges in the assessment and management of the ""difficult airway"" patient in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic era.

Methods A 60-year-old male with history of recent transoral robotic surgery resection, free flap reconstruction, and tracheostomy for p16+ squamous cell carcinoma presented with stridor and dyspnea 1 month after decannulation. Careful planning by a multidisciplinary team allowed for appropriate staffing and personal protective equipment, preparations for emergency airway management, evaluation via nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, and COVID testing. The patient was found to be COVID negative and underwent imaging which revealed new pulmonary nodules and a tracheal lesion.

Results The patient was safely transorally intubated in the operating room. The tracheal lesion was removed endoscopically and tracheostomy was avoided.

Conclusions This case highlights the importance of careful and collaborative decision making for the management of head and neck cancer and other ""difficult airway"" patients during the COVID-19 epidemic.",作者关键词:airway rapid response; COVID-19; difficult airway; head and neck cancer; personal protective equipment,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26175,Management of the difficult airway in the COVID-19 pandemic: Illustrative complex head and neck cancer scenario,"作者:Rassekh, CH (Rassekh, Christopher H.)[ 1 ] ; Jenks, CM (Jenks, Carolyn M.)[ 1 ] ; Ochroch, EA (Ochroch, E.

"摘要
In Italy, 128,948 confirmed cases and 15,887 deaths of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were registered as of 5 April 2020. Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

A new epidemiological model, termed SIDARTHE, distinguishes between diagnosed and undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as modeling effects of social distancing and widespread testing, to predict possible outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE MEDICINE,10.1038/s41591-020-0883-7,Modelling the COVID-19 epidemic and implementation of population-wide interventions in Italy,"作者:Giordano, G (Giordano, Giulia)[ 1 ] ; Blanchini, F (Blanchini, Franco)[ 2 ] ; Bruno, R (Bruno, Raffaele)[ 3,4 ] ; Colaneri, P (Colaneri, Patrizio)[ 5,6 ] ; Di Filippo, A (Di Filippo, Alessandro)[ 3 ] ; Di Matteo, A (Di Matteo, Angela)[ 3 ] ; Colaneri, M (Colaneri, Marta)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Italian grant PRIN 2017 'Monitoring and Control Underpinning the Energy-Aware Factory of the Future: Novel Methodologies and Industrial Validation' ,APR 2020,"Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Trento, Italy.

"摘要
The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Italy, in particular in the Milan focal point, required drastic measures and led to panic in the population. While in our center we did not change our approach to the treatment of our young patients with cancer, we developed a qualitative survey to assess their perception of the risk and level of stress. The survey showed that a relatively large proportion of young patients felt personally at risk of severe complications. We believe that we need to adequately inform our patients, focusing on hygienic measures and personal protection and prompt reporting of any suspicious symptoms.",作者关键词:adolescents; coronavirus; COVID-19; epidemic; fear; perception; survey,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER,e28318,"How young patients with cancer perceive the COVID-19 (coronavirus) epidemic in Milan, Italy: Is there room for other fears?","作者:Casanova, M (Casanova, Michela)[ 1 ] ; Bagliacca, EP (Bagliacca, Elena)[ 1 ] ; Silva, M (Silva, Matteo)[ 1 ] ; Patriarca, C (Patriarca, Carlo)[ 2 ] ; Veneroni, L (Veneroni, Laura)[ 1 ] ; Clerici, CA (Clerici, Carlo Alfredo)[ 3,4 ] ; Spreafico, F (Spreafico, Filippo)[ 1 ] ; Luksch, R (Luksch, Roberto)[ 1 ] ; Terenziani, M (Terenziani, Monica)[ 1 ] ; Meazza, C (Meazza, Cristina)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Oncology; Hematology; Pediatrics,Associazione Bianca Garavaglia Onlus ,10.1002/pbc.28318,"Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Pediat Oncol Unit, Via G Venezian 1, I-20133 Milan, Italy.

"摘要
Epidemiological data on seasonal influenza show that the growth rate of the number of infected individuals can increase passing from one exponential growth rate to another one with a larger exponent. Such behavior is not described by conventional epidemiological models. In this work an immuno-epidemiological model is proposed in order to describe this two-stage growth. It takes into account that the growth in the number of infected individuals increases the initial viral load and provides a passage from the first stage of epidemic where only people with weak immune response are infected to the second stage where people with strong immune response are also infected. This scenario may be viewed as an increase of the effective number of susceptible increasing the effective growth rate of infected.",作者关键词:Epidemic; immune response; over-exponential growth; influenza; COVID-19,文献类型:Article,MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF NATURAL PHENOMENA,27,Immuno-epidemiological model of two-stage epidemic growth,"作者:Banerjee, M (Banerjee, Malay)[ 1 ] ; Tokarev, A (Tokarev, Alexey)[ 2 ] ; Volpert, V (Volpert, Vitaly)[ 2,3,4 ]",研究方向:Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics,"Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation",出版年: APR 21 2020,"IIT Kanpur, Dept Math & Stat, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.

"摘要
We constructed a simple Susceptible{Exposed{Infectious{Removed model of the spread of COVID-19. The model is parametrised only by the average incubation period, , and two rate parameters: contact rate, fi, and exclusion rate, . The rates depend on nontherapeutic interventions and determine the basic reproduction number, R0 = fi=, and, together with , the daily multiplication coefficient in the early exponential phase, . Initial R0 determines the reduction of fi required to contain the spread of the epidemic. We demonstrate that introduction of a cascade of multiple exposed states enables the model to reproduce the distributions of the incubation period and the serial interval reported by epidemiologists. Using the model, we consider a hypothetical scenario in which fi is modulated solely by anticipated changes of social behaviours: first, fi decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, pressuring people to self-isolate, and then, over longer time scale, fi increases as people gradually accept the risk. In this scenario, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression, which, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop and deploy vaccine or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.",作者关键词:basic reproduction number; novel coronavirus,文献类型:Article,MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF NATURAL PHENOMENA,28,Dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic at constant and time-dependent contact rates,"作者:Kochanczyk, M (Kochanczyk, Marek)[ 1 ] ; Grabowski, F (Grabowski, Frederic)[ 2 ] ; Lipniacki, T (Lipniacki, Tomasz)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics,National Science Centre (Poland) ,出版年: APR 21 2020,"Polish Acad Sci, Inst Fundamental Technol Res, Dept Biosyst & Soft Matter, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland.

"摘要
Described as a global outbreak (pandemic) by the World Health Organization, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) raises great concern with more than 2 million infected patients worldwide. A series of measures are taken by governments worldwide to prevent the spread of the outbreak. As new cases increase, people are asked to stay at home. Active living areas such as sports centers, parks and schools are closed in most countries. In this process, staying at home for a long time makes it difficult for individuals with special needs such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) to stay physically active as well as typically developing individuals. The education process of children with ASD is disrupted, especially due to closed special education schools and rehabilitation centers. Online learning environments are often not suitable for children with ASD. It is predicted that excessive weight, obesity and sedentary life, which are high in children with ASD, may increase even more due to COVID-19. This article outlines the benefits of physical activity for children with ASD and provides strategies and examples of physical activity for children with ASD during the COVID-19 outbreak. The article is thought to be a guide for encouraging children with ASD in the home environment to physical activity.",作者关键词:COVID-19; children with ASD; stay at home; physical activity,文献类型:Article; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,10.1080/20473869.2020.1756115,"Promoting physical activity for children with autism spectrum disorders during Coronavirus outbreak: benefits, strategies, and examples","作者:Yarimkaya, E (Yarimkaya, Erkan)[ 1 ] ; Esenturk, OK (Esenturk, Oguz Kaan)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Education & Educational Research; Rehabilitation,,APR 2020,"Minist Natl Educ, TOBB Orence Secondary Sch, TR-69300 Bayburt, Turkey.

Background The clinical knowledge about the course, complications and treatment of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is so far limited. Aim This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China. In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented. Methods This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6-2143 children infected with SARS-CoV-2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. Results The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18-45% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5-20 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40-100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. Conclusion COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children. Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Acute respiratory tract infection; Pediatric; Pneumonia,文献类型:Review; Early Access,MONATSSCHRIFT KINDERHEILKUNDE,10.1007/s00112-020-00919-7,COVID-19 in hospitalized children and adolescents A systematic review on published case series (as of 31.03.2020) and first data from Germany,"作者:Streng, A (Streng, A.)[ 1 ] ; Hartmann, K (Hartmann, K.)[ 1 ] ; Armann, J (Armann, J.)[ 2 ] ; Berner, R (Berner, R.)[ 2 ] ; Liese, JG (Liese, J.

The emergence of COVID-19 has impacted orthopaedic surgery worldwide. India, with its large population and limited health resources, will be overwrought over the coming days due to the number of cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19. It is important to understand the challenges for orthopaedic (and other) surgeons in India when dealing with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article highlights the challenges in the triaging of patients, care in dealing with a patient with COVID-19 in orthopaedic surgery, and the effects on academics and research activities; it also suggests immediate measures and recommendations that also apply to other specialties.",作者关键词:COVID-19; coronavirus disease; orthopaedics; trauma; surgery,文献类型:Article; Early Access,TROPICAL DOCTOR,UNSP 0049475520921616,COVID-19 and orthopaedic surgeons: the Indian scenario,"作者:Jain, VK (Jain, Vijay K.)[ 1 ] ; Vaishya, R (Vaishya, Raju)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Tropical Medicine",,10.1177/0049475520921616,"Ram Manohar Lohia Hosp, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthpaed, New Delhi 110001, India.

"摘要
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early December 2019, 81 174 confirmed cases and 3242 deaths have been reported in China as of March 19, 2020. The Chinese people and government have contributed huge efforts to combat this disease, resulting in significant improvement of the situation, with 58 new cases (34 were imported cases) and 11 new deaths reported on March 19, 2020. However, as of March 19, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop in 167 countries/territories outside of China, and 128 665 confirmed cases and 5536 deaths have been reported, with 16 498 new cases and 817 new deaths occurring in last 24 hours. Therefore, the world should work together to fight against this pandemic. Here, we review the recent advances in COVID-19, including the insights in the virus, the responses of the host cells, the cytokine release syndrome, and the therapeutic approaches to inhibit the virus and alleviate the cytokine storm. By sharing knowledge and deepening our understanding of the virus and the disease pathogenesis, we believe that the community can efficiently develop effective vaccines and drugs, and the mankind will eventually win this battle against this pandemic.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; pathogenesis; evidence-based medicine; control and therapeutic strategies,文献类型:Review; Early Access,FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11684-020-0773-x,"Advances in COVID-19: the virus, the pathogenesis, and evidence-based control and therapeutic strategies","作者:Zhou, GB (Zhou, Guangbiao)[ 1 ] ; Chen, SJ (Chen, Saijuan)[ 2 ] ; Chen, Z (Chen, Zhu)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, State Key Lab Mol Oncol, Natl Canc Ctr, Natl Clin Res Ctr Canc,Canc Hosp, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus has led to more than a pandemic-indeed, COVID-19 is spawning myriad other concerns as it rapidly marches around the globe. One of these concerns is a surge of misinformation, which we argue should be viewed as a risk in its own right, and to which insights from decades of risk communication research must be applied. Further, when the subject of misinformation is itself a risk, as in the case of COVID-19, we argue for the utility of viewing the problem as a multi-layered risk communication problem. In such circumstances, misinformation functions as a meta-risk that interacts with and complicates publics' perceptions of the original risk. Therefore, as the COVID-19 ""misinfodemic"" intensifies, risk communication research should inform the efforts of key risk communicators. To this end, we discuss the implications of risk research for efforts to fact-check COVID-19 misinformation and offer practical recommendations.",作者关键词:Risk communication; misinformation; trust; uncertainty,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH,10.1080/13669877.2020.1756385,Fact-checking as risk communication: the multi-layered risk of misinformation in times of COVID-19,"作者:Krause, NM (Krause, Nicole M.)[ 1 ] ; Freiling, I (Freiling, Isabelle)[ 1,2 ] ; Beets, B (Beets, Becca)[ 1 ] ; Brossard, D (Brossard, Dominique)[ 1,3 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics,,APR 2020,"Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, Hiram Smith Hall,1545 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

"摘要
The purposes of this study was to assess the youth mental health after the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) occurred in China two weeks later, and to investigate factors of mental health among youth groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR = 8.71, 95%CI:1.97-38.43), being the enterprise employee (OR = 2.36, 95%CI:1.09-5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptom (OR = 1.05, 95%CI:1.03-1.07) and using negative coping styles (OR = 1.03, 95%CI:1.00-1.07). Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.",作者关键词:Post-traumatic stress disorder; Mental health; Negative coping styles; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY,10.1007/s11126-020-09744-3,The Effect of COVID-19 on Youth Mental Health,"作者:Liang, LL (Liang, Leilei)[ 1 ] ; Ren, H (Ren, Hui)[ 1,2 ] ; Cao, RL (Cao, Ruilin)[ 1 ] ; Hu, YY (Hu, Yueyang)[ 1 ] ; Qin, ZY (Qin, Zeying)[ 1 ] ; Li, CN (Li, Chuanen)[ 1 ] ; Mei, SL (Mei, Songli)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Psychiatry,International innovation team of Jilin University ,APR 2020,"Jilin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Hlth Management, 1163 Xinmin St, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China.

Objectives: There is an urgency to support Australian ED clinicians with real-time tools as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Quality Improvement Project has commenced and will provide flexible and responsive clinical tools to determine the predictors of key ED-relevant clinical outcomes.

Methods: The COVED Project includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED and meeting contemporary testing criteria for COVID-19. The dataset has been embedded in the electronic medical record and the COVED Registry has been developed.

Results: Outcomes measured include being COVID-19 positive and requiring intensive respiratory support. Regression methodology will be used to generate clinical prediction tools.

Conclusion: This project will support EDs during this pandemic.",作者关键词:emergency; registry; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA,10.1111/1742-6723.13513,Informing emergency care for COVID-19 patients: The COVID-19 Emergency Department Quality Improvement Project protocol,"作者:O'Reilly, GM (O'Reilly, Gerard M.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Mitchell, RD (Mitchell, Rob D.)[ 1,2 ] ; Noonan, MP (Noonan, Michael P.)[ 1 ] ; Hiller, R (Hiller, Ryan)[ 1 ] ; Mitra, B (Mitra, Biswadev)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Brichko, L (Brichko, Lisa)[ 1,2,4 ] ; Luckhoff, C (Luckhoff, Carl)[ 1 ] ; Paton, A (Paton, Andrew)[ 1,5 ] ; Smit, D (Smit, De Villiers)[ 1,2 ] ; Santamaria, MJ (Santamaria, Mark J.)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Emergency Medicine,,APR 2020,"The Alfred, Emergency & Trauma Ctr, POB 315, Prahran, Vic 3181, Australia.

People are facing uncertain and difficult times in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. The benefits of plants (psychological, health, economic, productive) in this period of forced isolation can be of key importance. If many of us have to self-isolate in urban or suburban environments, we need something to do to keep our bodies and minds active and fed. In such a challenging scenario, a vegetable garden in home spaces can bring recreational, health, economic and environmental benefits. Regardless of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is untapped potential for this kind of garden to impact environmental outcomes, public awareness, and market trends. Home vegetable gardens could provide a small-scale approach to the sustainable use of natural resources, leading towards self-sufficiency, self-regulation, sustainability, and environmental protection.",作者关键词:Covid-19 pandemic; Mediterranean climate; Mental and physical well-being; Home spaces; Plant benefits; Vegetable garden,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HUMAN ECOLOGY,10.1007/s10745-020-00147-3,Converting Home Spaces into Food Gardens at the Time of Covid-19 Quarantine: all the Benefits of Plants in this Difficult and Unprecedented Period,"作者:Sofo, A (Sofo, Adriano)[ 1 ] ; Sofo, A (Sofo, Antonino)",研究方向:Anthropology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Sociology,,APR 2020,"Univ Basilicata, Dept European & Mediterranean Cultures Architectu, Via Lanera 20, I-75100 Matera, Italy.

"摘要
Background Respiratory protective devices are critical in protecting against infection in healthcare workers at high risk of novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, recommendations are conflicting and epidemiological data on their relative effectiveness against COVID-19 are limited.

Purpose To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in healthcare workers.

Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2014, to March 9, 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1, 1990, to December 9, 2014.

Study Selection Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in healthcare workers.

Data Extraction Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence.

Data Synthesis Four RCTs were meta-analyzed adjusting for clustering. Compared with N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory-confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25; I-2 = 0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95% CI: 0.98-2.28; I-2 = 78%; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (P = .49).

Limitations Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence.

Conclusions Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in healthcare workers during non-aerosol-generating care. Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; masks; meta-analysis; N95 respirators; SARS-CoV-2; systematic review,文献类型:Review; Early Access,INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES,10.1111/irv.12745,Medical masks vs N95 respirators for preventing COVID-19 in healthcare workers: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials,"作者:Bartoszko, JJ (Bartoszko, Jessica J.)[ 1 ] ; Farooqi, MAM (Farooqi, Mohammed Abdul Malik)[ 2 ] ; Alhazzani, W (Alhazzani, Waleed)[ 1,3 ] ; Loeb, M (Loeb, Mark)[ 1,4 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Virology,,APR 2020,"McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

Methods This study included 150 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed from January 10 to February 12, 2020 to analyze their clinical and CT imaging characteristics. Results The period between symptom onset and initial CT examination ranged from 1 to 8 days. There were 83 cases (55.33%) involving both lungs, 67 cases (44.67%) involving a single lung (left 25 cases and right 42 cases). There were 49 cases (32.67%) of single intrapulmonary lesion, 33 cases (22.00%) of multiple intrapulmonary lesions, 68 cases (44.00%) of diffused intrapulmonary lesions, 67 cases (44.67%) of subpleural lesions, 24 cases (16.00%) of lesions localizing along the bronchovascular bundles, and 59 cases (39.33%) with lesions in both locations. There were 18 cases (12.00%) exhibiting ground-glass nodules of < 10 mm, 124 cases (82.67%) of patchy ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation, 8 cases (5.33%) of cord-like lesions, 6 cases (4.00%) of pleural effusion, and 2 cases (1.33%) of enlarged lymph nodes. Conclusions The main manifestations of initial chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia patients was ground-glass opacities, commonly involving single site in patients < 35 years old and multiple sites and extensive area in patients > 60 years old. The common lesion sites were the subpleural region and the posterior basal segments of the lower lobes, mostly showing thickening of the interlobular septum and mixed with consolidation.",作者关键词:COVID-19 pneumonia; CT imaging characteristics; Clinical manifestations,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s11604-020-00973-x,Imaging characteristics of initial chest computed tomography and clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,"作者:Fan, N (Fan, Na)[ 1 ] ; Fan, WH (Fan, WenHui)[ 1 ] ; Li, Z (Li, Zhen)[ 1 ] ; Shi, M (Shi, Min)[ 1 ] ; Liang, Y (Liang, Yi)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,APR 2020,"Gen Hosp Yangtze River Shipping, Dept Radiol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Data on COVID-19 supports targeted social distancing could be an effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality, but could inadvertently increase stigma for affected populations. As health care providers we must be aware of the facts of COVID-19, cultural implications, and potential for stigmatization of populations affected by COVID-2019. It is important to consider the real economic impact related to lost workdays due to quarantine and social isolation efforts as well as travel restrictions that may negatively impact access to care and ability to pay for care. Efforts geared towards general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization.

Countries who are successful at aggressive screening, early identification, patient isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and infection control methods should also address the risk of stigmatization among populations and the negative effects which could occur. The cases of COVID-19 will continue to rise and the virus will be sustainable for future infections. Timely and appropriate public health interventions addressing cultural impact and risk for stigmatization along with proper screening, treatment, and follow up for affected individuals and close contacts can reduce the number of infections, serious illness, and deaths.",作者关键词:coronaviruses; COVID; respiratory,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF TRANSCULTURAL NURSING,UNSP 1043659620917724,"COVID-19: Facts, Cultural Considerations, and Risk of Stigmatization","作者:Bruns, DP (Bruns, Debra Pettit)[ 1 ] ; Kraguljac, NV (Kraguljac, Nina Vanessa)[ 2 ] ; Bruns, TR (Bruns, Thomas R.)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Nursing,,10.1177/1043659620917724,"650 Univ Blvd East, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA.

Here, Iwasaki and Yang highlight the potential dangers of inducing suboptimal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. They stress the need for proper safety evaluation of candidate vaccines for COVID-19.

There is a desperate need for effective therapies and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the growing economic crisis that has ensued from societal lockdown. Vaccines are being developed at an unprecedented speed and are already in clinical trials, without preclinical testing for safety and efficacy. Yet, safety evaluation of candidate vaccines must not be overlooked.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE REVIEWS IMMUNOLOGY,10.1038/s41577-020-0321-6,The potential danger of suboptimal antibody responses in COVID-19,"作者:Iwasaki, A (Iwasaki, Akiko)[ 1,2 ] ; Yang, YX (Yang, Yexin)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Immunology,,APR 2020,"Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.

Flexible laryngoscopy, the gold-standard evaluation of the larynx and the pharynx, is one of the most commonly performed procedures in otolaryngology. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, flexible laryngoscopy represents a risk for patients and an occupational hazard for otolaryngologists and any clinic staff involved with the procedure or endoscope reprocessing. Here we present a set of recommendations on flexible laryngoscopy performance during the pandemic, including patient selection, personal protective equipment, and endoscope disinfection, based on a consensus reached during a virtual webinar on March 24, 2020, attended by approximately 300 participants from the American laryngology community.",作者关键词:otolaryngology; COVID-19; laryngoscopy,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820921395,Flexible Laryngoscopy and COVID-19,"作者:Rameau, A (Rameau, Anais)[ 1 ] ; Young, VN (Young, VyVy N.)[ 2 ] ; Amin, MR (Amin, Milan R.)[ 3 ] ; Sulica, L (Sulica, Lucian)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,10.1177/0194599820921395,"Weill Cornell Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Sean Parker Inst Voice, 240E 59th St, New York, NY 10021 USA.

The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the management of head and neck cancer must be addressed. Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers. However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis. The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes. Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; head and neck cancer,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820921413,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Management of Head and Neck Malignancies,"作者:Werner, MT (Werner, Michael T.)[ 1 ] ; Carey, RM (Carey, Ryan M.)[ 2 ] ; Albergotti, WG (Albergotti, W.

Purpose of Review Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. Recent Findings A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Immune response; Cardiovascular system; Cardiac injury; Cytokine storm,文献类型:Review,CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS,32,Cardiovascular Complications in Patients with COVID-19: Consequences of Viral Toxicities and Host Immune Response,"作者:Zhu, H (Zhu, Han)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Rhee, JW (Rhee, June-Wha)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Cheng, P (Cheng, Paul)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Waliany, S (Waliany, Sarah)[ 1 ] ; Chang, A (Chang, Amy)[ 1,4 ] ; Witteles, RM (Witteles, Ronald M.)[ 1,3 ] ; Maecker, H (Maecker, Holden)[ 5,6 ] ; Davis, MM (Davis, Mark M.)[ 5,6,7 ] ; Nguyen, PK (Nguyen, Patricia K.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Wu, SM (Wu, Sean M.)[ 1,2,3 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,American Heart Association,出版年: APR 21 2020,"Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Room G1120A,Lokey Stem Cell Bldg,265 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has quickly swept through China, and mass internal migration during the Chinese Spring Festival is now widely blamed for this. This statement, we argue, is misleading. Internal migrants should not be held responsible for the initial spread of COVID-19, as those cities first affected are megacities that connect with the epicentre Wuhan more with regard to business and tourism than migration. The scale of the epidemic can only be partially explained by internal migration. Severe outbreaks are not limited to cities that neighbour Hubei Province and that have large migration to Wuhan. They also occurred in provincial capitals that are neither contiguous with Hubei nor connected with Wuhan in terms of migration. Even though a few cities far away from the epicentre were hit severely by COVID-19 due to migration, the major contributor is not the migrant job seekers but business people. The responsibility of spreading COVD-19 so fast, on such a large scale and so far is by no means fully on internal migrants.",作者关键词:COVID-19; internal migration; geography; cartogram; China,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,0308518X20916764,Should internal migrants be held accountable for spreading COVID-19?,"作者:Shi, QJ (Shi, Qiujie)[ 1 ] ; Liu, T (Liu, Tao)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,National Natural Science Foundation of China,10.1177/0308518X20916764,"Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

Purpose The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is rapidly emerging as a global health threat. With no proven vaccination or treatment, infection control measures are paramount. In this article, we aim to describe the impact of COVID-19 on our practice and share our strategies and guidelines to maintain a sustainable ophthalmology practice. Methods Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Eye Centre is the only ophthalmology department supporting the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), which is the national screening center and the main center for management of COVID-19 patients in Singapore. Our guidelines during this outbreak are discussed. Results Challenges in different care settings in our ophthalmology practice have been identified and analyzed with practical solutions and guidelines implemented in anticipation of these challenges. First, to minimize cross-infection of COVID-19, stringent infection control measures were set up. These include personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers and routine cleaning of ""high-touch"" surfaces. Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients. Administrative measures to lower patient attendance and reschedule appointments were carried out. Third, inpatient and outpatient care were separated to minimize interactions. Last but not least, logistics and manpower plans were drawn up in anticipation of resource demands and measures to improve the mental well-being of staff were implemented. Conclusion We hope our measures during this COVID-19 pandemic can help ophthalmologists globally and serve to guide and maintain safe access in ophthalmology clinics when faced with similar disease outbreaks.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Clinic management; Singapore,文献类型:Article; Early Access,GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY,10.1007/s00417-020-04682-z,Sustainable practice of ophthalmology during COVID-19: challenges and solutions,"作者:Lim, LW (Lim, Louis W.)[ 1 ] ; Yip, LW (Yip, Leonard W.)[ 1 ] ; Tay, HW (Tay, Hui Wen)[ 2 ] ; Ang, XL (Ang, Xue Ling)[ 2 ] ; Lee, LK (Lee, Llewellyn K.)[ 1 ] ; Chin, CF (Chin, Chee Fang)[ 1 ] ; Yong, V (Yong, Vernon)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Ophthalmology,,APR 2020,"Tan Tock Seng Hosp, Natl Healthcare Grp Eye Inst, 11 Jalan Tan Tock Seng, Singapore 308433, Singapore.

Since COVID-19 was classified as a pandemic, the stream of important information from multiple sources is constant and always changing. As the pandemic evolves, the need to report relevant information to frontline providers remains crucial. A 1-page centralized document termed a ""quicksheet"" was developed to include guidelines, policies, and practical information and to serve as a reference tool for our clinicians. It was updated and distributed frequently, up to once daily. It was initially embraced as an important resource for resident physicians and then quickly adopted by the entire department as a necessary reference and communication tool during the ongoing crisis. The quicksheet has been a beneficial tool to distill and organize the most important and relevant information for frontline staff, and we hope that it can serve as a template for departments and health care workers in other hospital systems to adopt.",作者关键词:COVID-19; coronavirus; pandemic; information; communication; frontline,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820922988,Information Overload: A Method to Share Updates among Frontline Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"作者:Poonia, SK (Poonia, Seerat K.)[ 1 ] ; Rajasekaran, K (Rajasekaran, Karthik)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,10.1177/0194599820922988,"Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Perelman Sch Med, 3400 Spruce St,Fifth Floor Silverstein Bldg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R-0. Without self-isolation, when R-0= 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R-0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; hospitalization; self-isolation; critical care need,文献类型:Article,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.2004064117,Projecting hospital utilization during the COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States,"作者:Moghadas, SM (Moghadas, Seyed M.)[ 1 ] ; Shoukat, A (Shoukat, Affan)[ 2 ] ; Fitzpatrick, MC (Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.)[ 3 ] ; Wells, CR (Wells, Chad R.)[ 2 ] ; Sah, P (Sah, Pratha)[ 2 ] ; Pandey, A (Pandey, Abhishek)[ 2 ] ; Sachs, JD (Sachs, Jeffrey D.)[ 4 ] ; Wang, Z (Wang, Zheng)[ 5 ] ; Meyers, LA (Meyers, Lauren A.)[ 6 ] ; Singer, BH (Singer, Burton H.)[ 7 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),出版年: APR 21 2020,"Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.

Object The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally. As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. Methods Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. Results There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. Conclusion We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.",作者关键词:Global neurosurgery; COVID-19; Pandemic; Social media,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA,10.1007/s00701-020-04342-5,The impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons and the strategy for triaging non-emergent operations: a global neurosurgery study,"作者:Jean, WC (Jean, Walter C.)[ 1,2 ] ; Ironside, NT (Ironside, Natasha T.)[ 3 ] ; Sack, KD (Sack, Kenneth D.)[ 1 ] ; Felbaum, DR (Felbaum, Daniel R.)[ 2,4 ] ; Syed, HR (Syed, Hasan R.)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"George Washington Univ, Dept Neurol Surg, 2150 Penn Ave NW 7th Floor, Washington, DC 20037 USA.

Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented demand upon critical care services for invasive mechanical ventilation. There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. This is due to a number of factors including prognosis, optimal healthcare resource utilisation, and safety of healthcare workers when performing such a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure. Methods Literature review and proposed practical guideline based on the experience of a tertiary healthcare institution with 195 critical care admissions for COVID-19 up until 4th April 2020. Results A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team. Conclusion In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation. Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment. ORL-HNS surgeons can play a valuable role in forming tracheostomy teams to support critical care teams during this global pandemic.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; Novel coronavirus; COVID-19; Tracheostomy; Mechanical ventilation,文献类型:Review; Early Access,EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY,10.1007/s00405-020-05993-x,Recommendation of a practical guideline for safe tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Takhar, A (Takhar, Arunjit)[ 1 ] ; Walker, A (Walker, Abigail)[ 2 ] ; Tricklebank, S (Tricklebank, Stephen)[ 3 ] ; Wyncoll, D (Wyncoll, Duncan)[ 3 ] ; Hart, N (Hart, Nicholas)[ 4 ] ; Jacob, T (Jacob, Tony)[ 2 ] ; Arora, A (Arora, Asit)[ 1 ] ; Skilbeck, C (Skilbeck, Christopher)[ 1 ] ; Simo, R (Simo, Ricard)[ 1 ] ; Surda, P (Surda, Pavol)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology,King's College London ,APR 2020,"Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, London SE1 9RT, England.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures.

Otolaryngology residency training programs are facing a novel challenge due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The widespread impact and chronicity of this pandemic makes it unique from any crisis faced by our training programs to date. This international medical crisis has the potential to significantly alter the course of training for our current resident cohort. The decrease in clinical opportunities due to the limitations on elective surgical cases and office visits as well as potential resident redeployment could lead to a decline in overall experience as well as key indicator cases. It is important that we closely monitor the impact of this pandemic on resident education and ensure the implementation of alternative learning strategies while maintaining an emphasis on safety and well-being.",作者关键词:resident; education; otolaryngology; COVID-19; coronavirus,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820922502,Insights on Otolaryngology Residency Training during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"作者:Crosby, DL (Crosby, Dana L.)[ 1 ] ; Sharma, A (Sharma, Arun)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,10.1177/0194599820922502,"Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Sch Med, 720 N Bond St, Springfield, IL 62794 USA.

Head and neck examinations are commonly performed by all physicians. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has a high viral load in the upper airways, these examinations and procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract must be approached with caution.

"摘要
Background: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately.

Objective: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic.

Results: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings).

Conclusions: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCov; social media; public health; Twitter; infoveillance; infodemiology; health informatics; disease surveillance,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,e19016,Top Concerns of Tweeters During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infoveillance Study,"作者:Abd-Alrazaq, A (Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa)[ 1 ] ; Alhuwail, D (Alhuwail, Dari)[ 2,3 ] ; Househ, M (Househ, Mowafa)[ 1 ] ; Hamdi, M (Hamdi, Mounir)[ 1 ] ; Shah, Z (Shah, Zubair)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Qatar National Library ,出版年: APR 21 2020,"Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Doha Al Luqta St, Doha, Qatar.

"摘要
There is a growing appreciation that the regulation of the melatonergic pathways, both pineal and systemic, may be an important aspect in how viruses drive the cellular changes that underpin their control of cellular function. We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid-19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial ""cytokine storm"", as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian ""resetting"" of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl-CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway. Focussing on immune regulators has treatment implications for covid-19 and other viral infections.",作者关键词:aryl hydrocarbon receptor; covid-19; immune; influenza; melatonin; metabolism; mitochondria; sirtuin; treatment; viral infection,文献类型:Review; Early Access,REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY,e2109,"Melatonin: Roles in influenza, Covid-19, and other viral infections","作者:Anderson, G (Anderson, George)[ 1 ] ; Reiter, RJ (Reiter, Russel J.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Virology,,10.1002/rmv.2109,"CRC Scotland & London, London, England.

"摘要
The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly infectious, carries significant morbidity and mortality, and has rapidly resulted in strained health care system and hospital resources. In addition to patient-related care concerns in infected individuals, focus must also relate to diminishing community spread, protection of staff, case selection, and concentration of resources. The current document based on available data and consensus opinion addresses appropriate catheterization laboratory preparedness for treating these patients, including procedure-room readiness to minimize external contamination, safe donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) to eliminate risk to staff, and staffing algorithms to minimize exposure and maximize team availability. Case selection and management of both emergent and urgent procedures are discussed in detail, including procedures that may be safely deferred or performed bedside.",作者关键词:coronavirus; cathlab readiness; PPE,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS,10.1002/ccd.28887,Considerations for cardiac catheterization laboratory procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic perspectives from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Emerging Leader Mentorship (SCAI ELM) Members and Graduates,"作者:Szerlip, M (Szerlip, Molly)[ 1 ] ; Anwaruddin, S (Anwaruddin, Saif)[ 2 ] ; Aronow, HD (Aronow, Herbert D.)[ 3 ] ; Cohen, MG (Cohen, Mauricio G.)[ 4 ] ; Daniels, MJ (Daniels, Matthew J.)[ 5 ] ; Dehghani, P (Dehghani, Payam)[ 6 ] ; Drachman, DE (Drachman, Douglas E.)[ 7 ] ; Elmariah, S (Elmariah, Sammy)[ 8 ] ; Feldman, DN (Feldman, Dmitriy N.)[ 9,29 ] ; Garcia, S (Garcia, Santiago)[ 10 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,APR 2020,"Heart Hosp Baylor Plano, Intervent Cardiol, Plano, TX 75093 USA.

"摘要
Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak originated from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, at the end of 2019, it has become a clinical threat to the general population worldwide. Among people infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the intensive management of the critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) needs substantial medical resource. In the present article, we have summarized the promising drugs, adjunctive agents, respiratory supportive strategies, as well as circulation management, multiple organ function monitoring and appropriate nutritional strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 in the ICU based on the previous experience of treating other viral infections and influenza. These treatments are referable before the vaccine and specific drugs are available for COVID-19.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; Antiviral therapy; Adjunctive intervention; Respiratory support,文献类型:Review,ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE,45,Therapeutic strategies for critically ill patients with COVID-19,"作者:Li, L (Li, Lei)[ 1 ] ; Li, RR (Li, Ranran)[ 1 ] ; Wu, ZX (Wu, Zhixiong)[ 2 ] ; Yang, XH (Yang, Xianghong)[ 3 ] ; Zhao, MY (Zhao, Mingyan)[ 4 ] ; Liu, J (Liu, Jiao)[ 5 ] ; Chen, DC (Chen, Dechang)[ 1,5 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 20 2020,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Ruijin North Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Crit Care Med, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In December 2019, the first case of infection with a new virus COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), named coronavirus, was reported in the city of Wuhan, China. At that time, almost nobody paid any attention to it. The new pathogen, however, fast proved to be extremely infectious and dangerous, resulting in about 3-5% mortality. Over the few months that followed, coronavirus has spread over entire world. At the end of March, the total number of infections is fast approaching the psychological threshold of one million, resulting so far in tens of thousands of deaths. Due to the high number of lives already lost and the virus high potential for further spread, and due to its huge overall impact on the economies and societies, it is widely admitted that coronavirus poses the biggest challenge to the humanity after the second World war. The COVID-19 epidemic is provoking numerous questions at all levels. It also shows that modern society is extremely vulnerable and unprepared to such events. A wide scientific and public discussion becomes urgent.

"摘要
Since December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan led to an outbreak throughout China and the rest of the world. To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection. This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention. The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Severe; Coagulation dysfunction; Diagnosis; Treatment,文献类型:Article,MILITARY MEDICAL RESEARCH,19,Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19,"作者:Song, JC (Song, Jing-Chun)[ 1 ] ; Wang, G (Wang, Gang)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, W (Zhang, Wei)[ 3 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yang)[ 4 ] ; Li, WQ (Li, Wei-Qin)[ 5 ] ; Zhou, Z (Zhou, Zhou)[ 4 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 20 2020,"Chinese PLA, Dept Crit Care Med, Hosp 908, Joint Logist Support Forces, Nanchang 330002, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.

Introduction: The recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has made surgeons change and take on newer strategies and safe exercises. All elective cases have been put off, but oncology cases need to be done to prevent progression of the disease. There is concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation. Here we discuss how we have dealt with this in our colorectal surgery department taking into account current evidence about the danger of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery.

Discussion: We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum. The patient had near total intestinal obstruction. She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection. The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation. There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission. One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases.

Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke. We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure. We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.",作者关键词:COVID-19; laparoscopic surgery; colorectal; coronavirus,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC & ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES,10.1089/lap.2020.0241,The Technique and Justification for Minimally Invasive Surgery in COVID-19 Pandemic: Laparoscopic Anterior Resection for Near Obstructed Rectal Carcinoma,"作者:Pawar, T (Pawar, Tushar)[ 1 ] ; Pokharkar, A (Pokharkar, Ashish)[ 1 ] ; Gori, J (Gori, Jayesh)[ 1 ] ; Pandey, D (Pandey, Diwakar)[ 1 ] ; Rohila, J (Rohila, Jitender)[ 1 ] ; Dsouza, A (Dsouza, Ashwin)[ 1 ] ; Saklani, A (Saklani, Avanish)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Surgery,,APR 2020,"Homi Bhabha Natl Univ, Tata Mem Hosp, Dept Colorectal Surg, Dr Earnest Borges Rd, Mumbai 400012, Maharashtra, India.

Introduction

There is an urgent need to identify patients at high risk during the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Whether a history of stroke is associated with increased severity of disease or mortality is unknown.

Method

We pooled studies from published literature to assess the association of a history of stroke with outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

Results

A pooled analysis of 4 studies showed a similar to 2.5-fold increase in odds of severe COVID-19. While a trend was observed, there was no statistically significant association of stroke with mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Discussion

Our findings are limited by a small number of studies and sample size.

Conclusion

There is a similar to 2.5-fold increase in odds of severe COVID-19 illness with a history of cerebrovascular disease.",作者关键词:Cerebrovascular disease; COVID-19; Coronavirus,文献类型:Review; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE,1747493020921664,Cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increased disease severity in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A pooled analysis of published literature,"作者:Aggarwal, G (Aggarwal, Gaurav)[ 1 ] ; Lippi, G (Lippi, Giuseppe)[ 2 ] ; Henry, BM (Henry, Brandon Michael)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,10.1177/1747493020921664,"Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Cardiac Intens Care Unit, Inst Heart, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.

"摘要
There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery. Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with COVID-19. The mean age and body mass index were 46 +/- 12 years and 49 +/- 3 kg/m(2). Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.",作者关键词:Bariatric surgery; Gastric bypass; Complications; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Pneumonia,文献类型:Article; Early Access,OBESITY SURGERY,10.1007/s11695-020-04617-x,Bariatric Surgical Practice During the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Outbreak,"作者:Aminian, A (Aminian, Ali)[ 1 ] ; Kermansaravi, M (Kermansaravi, Mohammad)[ 2 ] ; Azizi, S (Azizi, Shahriar)[ 3 ] ; Alibeigi, P (Alibeigi, Peyman)[ 4 ] ; Safamanesh, S (Safamanesh, Sina)[ 5 ] ; Mousavimaleki, A (Mousavimaleki, Ali)[ 2 ] ; Rezaei, MT (Rezaei, Mohammad Taghi)[ 4 ] ; Faridi, M (Faridi, Maziar)[ 5 ] ; Mokhber, S (Mokhber, Somayeh)[ 2 ] ; Pazouki, A (Pazouki, Abdolreza)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Surgery,,APR 2020,"Cleveland Clin, Dept Gen Surg, Bariatr & Metab Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave,Desk M61, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.

This document from the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) aims to present the main imaging features, and the role of CT scan in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, describing, in particular, the typical findings which make it possible to identify the disease and distinguish it from bacterial causes of infection, and to define which category of patients may benefit from CT imaging. The precautions that must be taken when performing scans to protect radiologists and technologists from infection will be described. The organisational measures that can be taken within radiology departments in order to cope with the influx of patients, while continuing to manage other emergency and time-sensitive activity (e.g. oncology, other infectious diseases etc.), will be discussed.",作者关键词:Coronavirus infections; Pneumonia; Tomography; X-ray computed,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00330-020-06865-y,COVID-19 patients and the radiology department - advice from the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI),"作者:Revel, MP (Revel, Marie-Pierre)[ 1 ] ; Parkar, AP (Parkar, Anagha P.)[ 2,3 ] ; Prosch, H (Prosch, Helmut)[ 4 ] ; Silva, M (Silva, Mario)[ 5 ] ; Sverzellati, N (Sverzellati, Nicola)[ 5 ] ; Gleeson, F (Gleeson, Fergus)[ 6 ] ; Brady, A (Brady, Adrian)[ 7 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,APR 2020,"Univ Paris, Cochin Hosp, Dept Radiol, F-75006 Paris, France.

Background At present, the severity of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a focal point.

Methods To assess the factors associated with severity and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging and laboratory characteristics of confirmed 280 cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from 20 January to 20 February 2020.

Results The median age of patients in the mild group was 37.55 years, whilst that in the severe group was 63.04 years. The proportion of patients aged over 65 years in the severe group was significantly higher than that of the mild group (59.04% vs. 10.15%, P < 0.05). 85.54% of severe patients had diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, which was significantly higher than that of the mild group (51.81% vs. 7.11%, P = 0.025; 33.73% vs. 3.05%, P = 0.042). Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 +/- 0.45 vs. 2.65 +/- 1.06 days in the severe group, P < 0.001). Our study showed that comorbidity, time from illness onset to antiviral treatment and age >=65 were three major risk factors for COVID-19 progression, whilst comorbidity and time from illness onset to antiviral treatment were two major risk factors for COVID-19 recovery.

Conclusions The elderly and patients with underlying diseases are more likely to experience a severe progression of COVID-19. It is recommended that timely antiviral treatment should be initiated to slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.",作者关键词:severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19); antiviral treatment; disease progression; prognosis,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE,10.1111/joim.13063,Early antiviral treatment contributes to alleviate the severity and improve the prognosis of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),"作者:Wu, J (Wu, J.)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, W (Li, W.)[ 3 ] ; Shi, X (Shi, X.)[ 1 ] ; Chen, Z (Chen, Z.)[ 2 ] ; Jiang, B (Jiang, B.)[ 4 ] ; Liu, J (Liu, J.)[ 5 ] ; Wang, D (Wang, D.)[ 6 ] ; Liu, C (Liu, C.)[ 7 ] ; Meng, Y (Meng, Y.)[ 8 ] ; Cui, L (Cui, L.)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,Zhejiang University Special Scientific Research Fund for COVID-19 Prevention and Control ,APR 2020,"Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Diag & Treatment Infect Dis, Natl Clin Res Ctr Infect Dis, Coll Med,Affiliated Hosp 1, 79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou 310003, Peoples R China.

"摘要
After the outbreak of the disease COVID-19, it has reached pandemic proportions within a very short time. It is mainly transmitted human-to-human through direct contact with secretions from an infected person or through inhalation of droplets containing SARS-CoV-2. It is controversial whether the virus may be transmitted via tears. Exposed ocular surface can serve as a gateway in transmission and acquiring respiratory diseases. Considering the reported cases on healthcare workers indicating nosocomial transmission and the anatomical and physiological aspects it is perceived that ophthalmic healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the virus by virtue of their job. In this narrative review we discuss current evidence around detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human tears and forms of transmissions reported to date. We also provide a comprehensive approach that may be implemented in an ophthalmic care facility to protect healthcare personnel, as well as patients, from contracting the virus.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2; infection control,文献类型:Article; Early Access,OCULAR IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION,10.1080/09273948.2020.1755442,COVID-19: Limiting the Risks for Eye Care Professionals,"作者:Sadhu, S (Sadhu, Soumen)[ 1 ] ; Agrawal, R (Agrawal, Rupesh)[ 2,3,4 ] ; Pyare, R (Pyare, Richa)[ 5 ] ; Pavesio, C (Pavesio, Carlos)[ 4 ] ; Zierhut, M (Zierhut, Manfred)[ 6 ] ; Khatri, A (Khatri, Anadi)[ 7,8 ] ; Smith, JR (Smith, Justine R.)[ 9 ] ; de Smet, MD (de Smet, Marc D.)[ 10 ] ; Biswas, J (Biswas, Jyotirmay)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Ophthalmology,,APR 2020,"Tan Tock Seng Hosp, Natl Healthcare Grp, Eye Inst, Singapore 308433, Singapore.

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated viral infection (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) is a virulent, contagious viral pandemic that is affecting populations worldwide. As with any airborne viral respiratory infection, surgical and non-surgical patients may be affected.

Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent English-language literature pertaining to COVID-19 infection among adult patients.

Results: COVID-19 disease that requires hospitalization results in critical illness approximately 25% of the time and requires mechanical ventilation with positive airway pressure. Acute kidney injury, a marked hypercoagulable state, and sometimes myocarditis can be features of COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic severe acute lung injury. Even if not among the most seriously afflicted, older patients with medical comorbidities are both predisposed to infection and risk increased morbidity and mortality, however, all persons presenting for surgical intervention should be suspected of infection (and thus transmissibility) even if asymptomatic. Although most elective surgery has been curtailed by administrative or governmental fiat, patients will still need urgent or emergency operative intervention for time-sensitive disease processes such as malignant neoplasia or for true emergencies such as perforated viscus or traumatic injury. It is possible to provide safe surgical care for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and minimize nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers.

Conclusions: This guidance will facilitate appropriate protection of patients and staff, and maintenance of infection control measures to assist surgical personnel and facilities to prepare for COVID-19-infected adult patients requiring urgent or emergent operative intervention and to provide optimal patient care.",作者关键词:COVID-19; guidelines; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; SIS; virus infection,文献类型:Review; Early Access,SURGICAL INFECTIONS,10.1089/sur.2020.101,Surgical Infection Society Guidance for Operative and Peri-Operative Care of Adult Patients Infected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),"作者:Heffernan, DS (Heffernan, Daithi S.)[ 1,2 ] ; Evans, HL (Evans, Heather L.)[ 3 ] ; Huston, JM (Huston, Jared M.)[ 4,5 ] ; Claridge, JA (Claridge, Jeffrey A.)[ 6 ] ; Blake, DP (Blake, David P.)[ 7,8 ] ; May, AK (May, Addison K.)[ 9 ] ; Beilman, GS (Beilman, Greg S.)[ 10 ] ; Barie, PS (Barie, Philip S.)[ 11,12 ] ; Kaplan, LJ (Kaplan, Lewis J.)[ 13,14 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Providence Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Dept Surg, 830 Chalkstone Ave, Providence, RI 02908 USA.

"摘要
We explored the relationships between lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, pulmonary inflammation index (PII) and disease evolution in patients with (corona virus disease 2019) COVID-19. A total of 123 patients with COVID-19 were divided into mild and severe groups. Lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected on the first day of hospital admission and lung computed tomography results were quantified by PII. Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the two groups. A total of 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included in the analysis. There were significant differences in cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4(+ )T), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8(+ )T), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and PII between the two groups.

"摘要
With the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of individuals that need to be tested for COVID-19 has been rapidly increasing. A walk-through (WT) screening center using negative pressure booths that is inspired by the biosafety cabinet has been designed and implemented in Korea for easy screening of COVID-19 and for safe and efficient consultation for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. Here, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 WT screening center. The WT center increases patient access to the screening clinics and adequately protects healthcare personnel while reducing the consumption of personal protective equipment. It can also increase the number of people tested by 9-10 fold. However, there is a risk of cross-infection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths. These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant. A WT center can be implemented in other institutions and countries and modified depending on local needs to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.",作者关键词:Walk-through; Screening; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Pandemic,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e154,Walk-Through Screening Center for COVID-19: an Accessible and Efficient Screening System in a Pandemic Situation,"作者:Kim, SI (Kim, Sang Il)[ 1 ] ; Lee, JY (Lee, Ji Yong)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 20 2020,"H Plus Yangji Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis, 1636 Nambusunhwan Ro, Seoul 08779, South Korea.

"摘要
With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the number of infected patients was rapidly increasing in Daegu, Korea. With a maximum of 741 new patients per day in the city as of February 29, 2020, hospital-bed shortage was a great challenge to the local healthcare system. We developed and applied a remote brief severity scoring system, administered by telephone for assigning priority for hospitalization and arranging for facility isolation (""therapeutic living centers"") for the patients starting on February 29, 2020. Fifteen centers were operated for the 3,033 admissions to the COVID-19 therapeutic living centers. Only 81 cases (2.67%) were transferred to hospitals after facility isolation. We think that this brief severity scoring system for COVID-19 worked safely to solve the hospital-bed shortage. Telephone scoring of the severity of disease and therapeutic living centers could be very useful in overcoming the shortage of hospital-beds that occurs during outbreaks of infectious diseases.",作者关键词:Brief Severity Scoring System; Telephone; COVID-19; Facility Isolation; Therapeutic Living Center,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e152,"A Brief Telephone Severity Scoring System and Therapeutic Living Centers Solved Acute Hospital-Bed Shortage during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Daegu, Korea","作者:Kim, SW (Kim, Shin-Woo)[ 1 ] ; Lee, KS (Lee, Kyeong Soo)[ 2 ] ; Kim, K (Kim, Keonyeop)[ 3 ] ; Lee, JJ (Lee, Jung Jeung)[ 4 ] ; Kim, JY (Kim, Jong-yeon)[ 5 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 20 2020,"Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, 130 Dongdeok Ro, Daegu 41944, South Korea.

"摘要
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that causes COVID-19 infection, has recently emerged and caused a deadly pandemic. Studies have shown that this virus causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality rate in older adults and those with comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). A significant percentage of older American adults have these diseases, putting them at a higher risk of infection. Additionally, many adults with hypertension, diabetes, and CKD are placed on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Studies have shown that these medications upregulate the ACE-2 receptor, the very receptor that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter host cells. Although it has been hypothesized that this may cause a further increased risk of infection, more studies on the role of these medications in COVID-19 infections are necessary. In this review, we discuss the transmission, symptomatology, and mortality of COVID-19 as they relate to older adults, and possible treatments that are currently under investigation.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; mortality; older adults; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY,10.1111/jgs.16472,COVID-19 and Older Adults: What We Know,"作者:Shahid, Z (Shahid, Zainab)[ 1,2 ] ; Kalayanamitra, R (Kalayanamitra, Ricci)[ 3,4 ] ; McClafferty, B (McClafferty, Brendan)[ 1 ] ; Kepko, D (Kepko, Douglas)[ 1 ] ; Ramgobin, D (Ramgobin, Devyani)[ 5 ] ; Patel, R (Patel, Ravi)[ 6 ] ; Aggarwal, CS (Aggarwal, Chander Shekher)[ 7 ] ; Vunnam, R (Vunnam, Ramarao)[ 6 ] ; Sahu, N (Sahu, Nitasa)[ 6 ] ; Bhatt, D (Bhatt, Dhirisha)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Geriatrics & Gerontology,,APR 2020,"Lake Erie Coll Osteopath Med, 1858 W Grandview Blvd, Erie, PA 16509 USA.

In December 2019, numerous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were reported in Wuhan, China, which has since spread throughout the world. However, its impact on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is unknown. Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a 61-year-old female RA patient who was receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs). The patient presented with a 4-day history of myalgia and febrile sensation. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated. The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine. Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved. Three weeks later, real-time PCR for COVID-19 showed negative conversion, and the patient was discharged without any complications.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pneumonia; Rheumatoid arthritis; Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs,文献类型:Article; Early Access,RHEUMATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL,10.1007/s00296-020-04584-7,Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) complicated with pneumonia in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs,"作者:Song, J (Song, Jehun)[ 1 ] ; Kang, S (Kang, Seongmin)[ 1 ] ; Choi, SW (Choi, Seung Won)[ 1 ] ; Seo, KW (Seo, Kwang Won)[ 2 ] ; Lee, S (Lee, Sunggun)[ 3 ] ; So, MW (So, Min Wook)[ 4 ] ; Lim, DH (Lim, Doo-Ho)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Rheumatology,,APR 2020,"Univ Ulsan, Ulsan Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Div Rheumatol,Dept Internal Med, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan Doro, Ulsan 44033, South Korea.

"摘要
The expressive number of deaths and confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 call for an urgent demand of effective and available drugs for COVID-19 treatment. CD147, a receptor on host cells, is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Thus, drugs that interfere in the spike protein/CD147 interaction or CD147 expression may inhibit viral invasion and dissemination among other cells, including in progenitor/stem cells. Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions; however, its possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 invasion has not yet been evaluated. In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release. Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients. This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair. Clinical tests with allogeneic MSCs from healthy individuals are underway to enhance endogenous lung repair and suppress inflammation.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; Lung stem cells; Coronavirus; Cellular therapy; Asthma; Diabetes mellitus; Invasion; Anti-viral responses; Basigin; EMMPRIN,文献类型:Article; Early Access,STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS,10.1007/s12015-020-09976-7,CD147 as a Target for COVID-19 Treatment: Suggested Effects of Azithromycin and Stem Cell Engagement,"作者:Ulrich, H (Ulrich, Henning)[ 1 ] ; Pillat, MM (Pillat, Micheli M.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),APR 2020,"Fed Univ Santa Maria RS, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Ave Roraima 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.

Introduction The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has exposed vulnerable populations to an unprecedented global health crisis. The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy.

Material and methods We searched databases for all case reports and series from 12 February to 4 April 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed.

Results Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between 8 December 2019 and 1 April 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%). Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section. Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported.

Conclusions Although the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported. Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; fever; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; neonatal morbidity; neonatal mortality; pandemic; pregnancy; respiratory distress syndrome; SARS-CoV-2; virus,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA,10.1111/aogs.13867,Maternal and perinatal outcomes with COVID-19: A systematic review of 108 pregnancies,"作者:Zaigham, M (Zaigham, Mehreen)[ 1,2 ] ; Andersson, O (Andersson, Ola)[ 3,4 ]",研究方向:Obstetrics & Gynecology,Region Skane ,APR 2020,"Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, S-20501 Malmo, Sweden.

"摘要
The reliable detection of transcription events through the quantification of the corresponding mRNA is of paramount importance for the diagnostics of infections and diseases. The quantification and localization analysis of the transcripts of a particular gene allows disease states to be characterized more directly compared to an analysis on the transcriptome wide level. This is particularly needed for the early detection of virus infections as now required for emergent viral diseases, e. g. Covid-19. In situ mRNA analysis, however, is a formidable challenge and currently performed with sets of single-fluorophore-containing oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the mRNA in question. Often a large number of probe strands (>30) are required to get a reliable signal. The more oligonucleotide probes are used, however, the higher the potential off-target binding effects that create background noise. Here, we used click chemistry and alkyne-modified DNA oligonucleotides to prepare multiple-fluorophore-containing probes. We found that these multiple-dye probes allow reliable detection and direct visualization of mRNA with only a very small number (5-10) of probe strands. The new method enabled the in situ detection of viral transcripts as early as 4 hours after infection.",作者关键词:click chemistry; fluorescence probes; mRNA detection; RNA-FISH; viral infection,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CHEMBIOCHEM,10.1002/cbic.202000081,Supersensitive Multifluorophore RNA-FISH for Early Virus Detection and Flow-FISH by Using Click Chemistry,"作者:Raddaoui, N (Raddaoui, Nada)[ 1 ] ; Croce, S (Croce, Stefano)[ 1,2 ] ; Geiger, F (Geiger, Florian)[ 1 ] ; Borodavka, A (Borodavka, Alexander)[ 3,4 ] ; Mockl, L (Moeckl, Leonhard)[ 1 ] ; Stazzoni, S (Stazzoni, Samuele)[ 1 ] ; Viverge, B (Viverge, Bastien)[ 1 ] ; Brauchle, C (Braeuchle, Christoph)[ 1 ] ; Frischmuth, T (Frischmuth, Thomas)[ 2 ] ; Engelke, H (Engelke, Hanna)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,German Research Foundation (DFG),APR 2020,"Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Chem, Butenandtstr 5-13, D-81377 Munich, Germany.

"摘要
The COVID- 19 pandemic is a critical test for the already overburdened and mostly underfunded public healthcare systems of Latin America. In a region that suffers from severe inequalities, public healthcare systems are the only source of medical care for a large sector of the population who work in the informal economy or are unemployed. State-run hospitals and clinics are already overstressed by continuous demand for treatment of vector-borne diseases and community-acquired infections as well as high rates of non-communicable diseases. Ideological misconceptions and denial among Latin America's political leaders prevented timely preparations for the pandemic and added to chronic governance problems. As ethical expertise in Latin America focuses on research ethics, few hospitals in the region have functioning clinical ethics committees or clinical ethics policy, forcing healthcare personnel to make excruciating treatment decisions in an environment dominated by material scarcity and public distrust. This essay examines the emergence of COVID-19 in Latin America and the serious challenge that it poses for Latin America's public healthcare systems.",作者关键词:resource allocation; health care; Latin American public healthcare systems; inequalities; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS,10.1111/dewb.12262,Latin American healthcare systems in times of pandemic,"作者:Litewka, SG (Litewka, Sergio G.)[ 1,2 ] ; Heitman, E (Heitman, Elizabeth)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity ,APR 2020,"Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Inst Bioeth, Miami, FL 33136 USA.

"摘要
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 and 2020 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation, effusions, and rapid respiratory compromise. The result of this pandemic is a large and increasing number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation and prolonged ventilator support. The rapid rise in endotracheal intubations coupled with prolonged ventilation requirements will certainly lead to an increase in tracheostomy procedures in the coming weeks and months. Performing tracheostomy in the setting of active COV-SARS-CoV-2, when necessary, poses a unique situation, with unique risks and benefits for both the patient and the health care providers. The New York Head and Neck Society has collaborated on this document to provide guidance on the performance of tracheostomies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",作者关键词:airway; COVID19; SARS-CoV-2; tracheal stenosis; tracheostomy,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26166,Tracheostomy during COV-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Recommendations from the New York Head and Neck Society,"作者:Miles, BA (Miles, Brett A.)[ 1 ] ; Schiff, B (Schiff, Bradley)[ 2 ] ; Ganly, I (Ganly, Ian)[ 3 ] ; Ow, T (Ow, Thomas)[ 2 ] ; Cohen, E (Cohen, Erik)[ 5 ] ; Genden, E (Genden, Eric)[ 1 ] ; Culliney, B (Culliney, Bruce)[ 1 ] ; Mehrotra, B (Mehrotra, Bhoomi)[ 4 ] ; Savona, S (Savona, Steven)[ 6 ] ; Wong, RJ (Wong, Richard J.)[ 3 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA.

"摘要
Background: The current global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, surgical societies have recommended that procedures with a high risk of aerosolization be avoided or delayed. However, some high-risk procedures, such as those related to head and neck malignancies, cannot always be delayed. Care must be taken during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize viral transmission as much as possible. Preoperative testing for COVID-19, limited operating room personnel, adequate personal protective equipment, and surgical technique are factors to consider for high-risk procedures.

Methods: This article presents the case of an awake tracheotomy performed for a transglottic mass causing airway obstruction.

Results: With detailed planning and specific techniques, the amount of aerosolization was reduced, and the procedure was performed as safely as possible.

Conclusion: This case provides a template for future aerosol-generating procedures during respiratory pandemics.",作者关键词:tracheotomy; COVID-19; pandemic,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC & ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES,10.1089/lap.2020.0239,Surgical Considerations for an Awake Tracheotomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"作者:Crossley, J (Crossley, Jason)[ 1 ] ; Clark, C (Clark, Christine)[ 1 ] ; Brody, F (Brody, Fredrick)[ 2 ] ; Maxwell, JH (Maxwell, Jessica H.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Surgery,,APR 2020,"Washington DC VAMC, 50 Irving St NW 2A-112, Washington, DC 20422 USA.

"摘要
A global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic occurred at the start of 2020 and is already responsible for more than 74 000 deaths worldwide, just over 100 years after the influenza pandemic of 1918. At the center of the crisis is the highly infectious and deadly SARS-CoV-2, which has altered everything from individual daily lives to the global economy and our collective consciousness. Aside from the pulmonary manifestations of disease, there are likely to be several electrophysiologic (EP) sequelae of COVID-19 infection and its treatment, due to consequences of myocarditis and the use of QT-prolonging drugs. Most crucially, the surge in COVID-19 positive patients that have already overwhelmed the New York City hospital system requires conservation of hospital resources including personal protective equipment (PPE), reassignment of personnel, and reorganization of institutions, including the EP laboratory. In this proposal, we detail the specific protocol changes that our EP department has adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including performance of only urgent/emergent procedures, after hours/7-day per week laboratory operation, single attending-only cases to preserve PPE, appropriate use of PPE, telemedicine and video chat follow-up appointments, and daily conferences to collectively manage the clinical and ethical dilemmas to come. We discuss also discuss how we perform EP procedures on presumed COVID positive and COVID tested positive patients to highlight issues that others in the EP community may soon face in their own institution as the virus continues to spread nationally and internationally.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; electrophysiology laboratory; pandemic,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,10.1111/jce.14493,Performance of electrophysiology procedures at an academic medical center amidst the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,"作者:Rubin, GA (Rubin, Geoffrey A.)[ 1 ] ; Biviano, A (Biviano, Angelo)[ 1 ] ; Dizon, J (Dizon, Jose)[ 1 ] ; Yarmohammadi, H (Yarmohammadi, Hirad)[ 1 ] ; Ehlert, F (Ehlert, Frederick)[ 1 ] ; Saluja, D (Saluja, Deepak)[ 1 ] ; Rubin, DA (Rubin, David A.)[ 1 ] ; Morrow, JP (Morrow, John P.)[ 1 ] ; Waase, M (Waase, Marc)[ 1 ] ; Berman, J (Berman, Jeremy)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,APR 2020,"622 W168 St,PH 3 Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA.

"摘要
The 2019-2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health issue. Lockdown is among options suggested to reduce spread of the virus. This study aimed to determining the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Tunisian consumer awareness, attitudes and behaviors related to food wastage. An online survey was conducted during the first 2 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown. The survey collected information on demographic data, awareness and attitudes toward food waste, food purchase behavior and household food expenditure estimation; extent of household food waste; willingness and information needs to reduce food waste. This study included 284 respondents. About 89% of respondents claimed to be aware of food waste, and the COVID-19 lockdown would impact for 93% of respondents, their waste levels, and for 80%, their grocery shopping habits. Interestingly, the COVID-19 lockdown improved food shopping performances and pushed toward a positive behavioral change regarding food wastage: 85% respondents declared nothing of what they bought would be discarded, and most of the respondents have set up a strategy of saving, storing and eating leftovers. The most cited reasons given for discarding food were overcooking, inappropriate storage and overbuying. Consumers' changes in food waste prevention might be probably driven more by the socioeconomical context of the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. food availability, restricted movements, loss of income), than by a pro-environmental concern. Finally, our study pointed out the consumers' needs of information for taking further action. In conclusion, our study can constitute a basis to further promote household food waste prevention behavior, outlasting the COVID-19 crisis.",作者关键词:COVID-19 lockdown; Household food waste; Saving strategy; Consumers' behavior,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,10.1007/s10668-020-00740-y,COVID-19 virus outbreak lockdown: What impacts on household food wastage?,"作者:Jribi, S (Jribi, Sarra)[ 1 ] ; Ben Ismail, H (Ben Ismail, Hanen)[ 1,2 ] ; Doggui, D (Doggui, Darine)[ 3 ] ; Debbabi, H (Debbabi, Hajer)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,APR 2020,"Univ Carthage, Natl Inst Agron Tunisia INAT, Dept Agri Food Ind, UR17AGR01, Tunis, Tunisia.

"摘要
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 as their common receptor. During infection, ACE2-expressing tissues become direct targets, resulting in serious pathological changes and progressive multiple organ failure or even death in severe cases. However, as an essential component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 confers protective effects in physiological circumstance, including maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, fluid, and electrolyte balance. The absence of protective role of ACE2 leads to dysregulated RAS and thus acute changes under multiple pathological scenarios including SARS. This potentially shared mechanism may also be the molecular explanation for pathogenesis driven by SARS-CoV-2. We reasonably speculate several potential directions of clinical management including host-directed therapies aiming to restore dysregulated RAS caused by ACE2 deficiency. Enriched knowledge of ACE2 learned from SARS and COVID-19 outbreaks can provide, despite their inherent tragedy, informative clues for emerging pandemic preparedness.",作者关键词:COVID-19; renin-angiotensin system; SARS,文献类型:Review; Early Access,FASEB JOURNAL,10.1096/fj.202000782,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2: A double-edged sword?,"作者:Yan, TT (Yan, Tiantian)[ 1 ] ; Xiao, R (Xiao, Rong)[ 1 ] ; Lin, GA (Lin, Guoan)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,,APR 2020,"990th Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, Mil Burn Ctr, Fengguang St 1, Zhumadian 463000, Henan, Peoples R China.

Background Respiratory complications have been well remarked in the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19), yet an emerging body of research indicates that cardiac involvement may be implicated in poor outcomes for these patients.

Aims This review seeks to gather and distill the existing body of literature that describes the cardiac implications of COVID-19.

Materials and Methods The English literature was reviewed for papers dealing with the cardiac effects of COVID-19.

Results Notably, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are counted in greater frequency in intensive care unit settings, and ultimately suffer greater rates of mortality. Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction. In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels. With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients. Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice.

Conclusion While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.",作者关键词:cardiac surgery; COVID-19; heart; respiratory failure; virus,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY,10.1111/jocs.14538,"Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients: Risk factors, predictors, and complications: A review","作者:Aghagoli, G (Aghagoli, Ghazal)[ 1 ] ; Marin, BG (Marin, Benjamin Gallo)[ 1 ] ; Soliman, LB (Soliman, Luke B.)[ 1 ] ; Sellke, FW (Sellke, Frank W.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Surgery,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

The novel coronavirus disease is currently causing a major pandemic. It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Betacoronavirus genus that also includes the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. While patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness, some patients also report gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Studies have identified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients, and its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 was found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. These suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can actively infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract. This has important implications to the disease management, transmission, and infection control. In this article, we review the important gastrointestinal aspects of the disease.",作者关键词:coronavirus; Covid-19; diarrhea; gastrointestinal infection; pneumonia,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY,10.1111/jgh.15047,Covid-19 and the digestive system,"作者:Wong, SH (Wong, Sunny H.)[ 1,2 ] ; Lui, RNS (Lui, Rashid N.

"摘要
Novel 2019 coronavirus has created havoc across the globe since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and fast spreading potential. While we were able to identify the causative agent within a few days of the disease outbreak, several questions still remain unanswered. In this review, we discuss the extent of virus spread, current statistics, SARS-CoV-2 genome organization, comparison between the novel coronavirus and causative agents involved in previous outbreaks, ongoing clinical trials and myths associated with the virus. Lastly, we provide insights into the future perspectives which could prove useful for the scientific community as they work on finding the cure against the disease.

Impact statement

Early availability of the sequence, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), has prompted efforts towards identifying a safe and effective vaccine in the current public health emergency. To that end, understanding the pathophysiology of disease is crucial for scientists around the world. Since conventional vaccine development and manufacturing may take several years, it is important to think about alternative strategies that we could use to mitigate imminent catastrophe. We hope that this article will open up new avenues and provide insights that could potentially save hundreds of lives affected by COVID-19.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; coronavirus; Wuhan; 2019-nCoV; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; China,文献类型:Review; Early Access,EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,UNSP 1535370220920540,"Novel 2019 coronavirus: Genome structure, clinical trials, and outstanding questions","作者:Jogalekar, MP (Jogalekar, Manasi P.)[ 1 ] ; Veerabathini, A (Veerabathini, Anurag)[ 2 ] ; Gangadaran, P (Gangadaran, Prakash)[ 3,4 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,,10.1177/1535370220920540,"Kyungpook Natl Univ, Kyungpook Natl Univ Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Nucl Med, Daegu 41944, South Korea.

As the world reacts with unprecedented efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of organizational leaders is to embark on a parallel track to keep mission-critical initiatives moving forward. One track includes preparing their organizations for the next ""novel"" virus. After all, organizations do not hire leaders to maintain the status quo; they are hired to drive the future. As much as death and taxes are inevitable, it is equally predictable that all organizations will sooner or later confront a black swan event. History teaches us that while the order of magnitude may vary, management crises are not entirely novel. This article explores a series of early risk mitigation strategies to prevent the next COVID-19 and prepare leadership to face this inevitable challenge.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION,10.1080/10810730.2020.1749193,Today's Leadership Lesson: Mind the Wildlife and Prepare for Tomorrow's Disruption,"作者:Shore, DA (Shore, David A.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Communication; Information Science & Library Science,,APR 2020,"Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

An 80-year-old man with multiple comorbidities presented to the emergency department with tachypnea, tachycardia, fever, and critically low O-2 saturation and definitive chest computerized tomography scan findings in favor of COVID-19 and positive PCR results in 48 hours.

"摘要
Objectives To assess the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia to respond to the expected increase in demand associated with COVID-19.

Design Analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020).

Settings All Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities.

Main outcome measures Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator-to-bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities.

Results The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population). Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase). This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline). An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators.

Conclusions The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID-19. But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.",作者关键词:Intensive care; Resource allocation; COVID-19; Epidemics; Respiratory tract infections; Hospitals; Respiration; artificial,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA,10.5694/mja2.50596,Surge capacity of intensive care units in case of acute increase in demand caused by COVID-19 in Australia,"作者:Litton, E (Litton, Edward)[ 1,2 ] ; Bucci, T (Bucci, Tamara)[ 2 ] ; Chavan, S (Chavan, Shaila)[ 2 ] ; Ho, YY (Ho, Yvonne Y.)[ 3 ] ; Holley, A (Holley, Anthony)[ 4,5 ] ; Howard, G (Howard, Gretta)[ 6 ] ; Huckson, S (Huckson, Sue)[ 2,7 ] ; Kwong, P (Kwong, Philomena)[ 8 ] ; Millar, J (Millar, Johnny)[ 9 ] ; Nguyen, N (Nguyen, Nhi)[ 10,11 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,APR 2020,"Fiona Stanley Hosp, Perth, WA, Australia.

"摘要
Since in vitro studies and a preliminary clinical report suggested the efficacy of chloroquine for COVID-19-associated pneumonia, there is increasing interest in this old antimalarial drug. In this article, we discuss the pharmacokinetics and safety of chloroquine that should be considered in light of use in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Chloroquine is well absorbed and distributes extensively resulting in a large volume of distribution with an apparent and terminal half-life of 1.6 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Chloroquine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and renal clearance is responsible for one third of total clearance. The lack of reliable information on target concentrations or doses for COVID-19 implies that for both adults and children, doses that proved effective and safe in malaria should be considered, such as 'loading doses' in adults (30 mg/kg over 48 h) and children (70 mg/kg over 5 days), which reported good tolerability. Here, plasma concentrations were < 2.5 mu mol/L, which is associated with (minor) toxicity. While the influence of renal dysfunction, critical illness, or obesity seems small, in critically ill patients, reduced absorption may be anticipated. Clinical experience has shown that chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, as three times the adult therapeutic dosage for malaria can be lethal when given as a single dose. Although infrequent, poisoning in children is extremely dangerous where one to two tablets can potentially be fatal. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of chloroquine suggest that chloroquine can be used safely for an acute virus infection, under corrected QT monitoring, but also that the safety margin is small, particularly in children.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,10.1007/s40262-020-00891-1,Chloroquine for SARS-CoV-2: Implications of Its Unique Pharmacokinetic and Safety Properties,"作者:Smit, C (Smit, Cornelis)[ 1,2 ] ; Peeters, MYM (Peeters, Mariska Y.

This review based on the actual results of epidemic prevention management in radiology departments in epidemic areas, and using designated hospital management methods, to summarize the radiology protection system. With the cooperation of the whole hospital and radiology department, a number of effective evaluation methods have been carried out to ensure the optimization of clinical protection. These practical methods provide a basis for the further promotion of management strategies and reduction of nosocomial infection. To our knowledge, the establishment of standardized protection and clear process has opened up a new idea of epidemic prevention management, which can effectively provide timely, efficient, and accurate support for clinical research, and promote the transformation from clinical research type to scientific research management type.",作者关键词:Novel coronavirus; Pneumonia epidemic; Prevention; Hospital management,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s11604-020-00974-w,The prevention and management of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in radiology departments in epidemic areas,"作者:Deng, M (Deng, Ming)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,APR 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Dept Radiol, 169 Donghu Rd, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China.

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted and devastated the world. As the infection spreads, the projected mortality and economic devastation are unprecedented. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities may be at a particular disadvantage as many already assume the status of a marginalized group. Black Americans have a long-standing history of disadvantage and are in a vulnerable position to experience the impact of this crisis and the myth of Black immunity to COVID-19 is detrimental to promoting and maintaining preventative measures. We are the first to present the earliest available data in the peer-reviewed literature on the racial and ethnic distribution of COVID-19-confirmed cases and fatalities in the state of Connecticut. We also seek to explode the myth of Black immunity to the virus. Finally, we call for a National Commission on COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities to further explore and respond to the unique challenges that the crisis presents for Black and Brown communities.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic; Race; Ethnicity; Disparity,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES,10.1007/s40615-020-00756-0,The COVID-19 Pandemic: a Call to Action to Identify and Address Racial and Ethnic Disparities,"作者:Laurencin, CT (Laurencin, Cato T.)[ 1,2 ] ; McClinton, A (McClinton, Aneesah)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","United States Department of Health & Human Services

"摘要
We report on the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy in relation to the extraordinary measures implemented by the Italian Government between the 24th of February and the 12th of March. We analysed the Covid-19 cumulative incidence (CI) using data from the 1st to the 31st of March. We estimated that in Lombardy, the worst hit region in Italy, the observed Covid-19 CI diverged towards values lower than the ones expected in the absence of government measures approximately 7-10 days after the measures implementation. The Covid-19 CI growth rate peaked in Lombardy the 22nd of March and in other regions between the 24th and the 27th of March. The CI growth rate peaked in 87 out of 107 Italian provinces on average 13.6 days after the measures implementation. We projected that the CI growth rate in Lombardy should substantially slow by mid-May 2020. Other regions should follow a similar pattern. Our projections assume that the government measures will remain in place during this period. The evolution of the epidemic in different Italian regions suggests that the earlier the measures were taken in relation to the stage of the epidemic, the lower the total cumulative incidence achieved during this epidemic wave. Our analyses suggest that the government measures slowed and eventually reduced the Covid-19 CI growth where the epidemic had already reached high levels by mid-March (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto) and prevented the rise of the epidemic in regions of central and southern Italy where the epidemic was at an earlier stage in mid-March to reach the high levels already present in northern regions. As several governments indicate that their aim is to ""push down"" the epidemic curve, the evolution of the epidemic in Italy supports the WHO recommendation that strict containment measures should be introduced as early as possible in the epidemic curve.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Epidemic; Italy; Cumulative incidence; Growth rate; Projections,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,10.1007/s10654-020-00631-6,"Covid-19 epidemic in Italy: evolution, projections and impact of government measures","作者:Sebastiani, G (Sebastiani, Giovanni)[ 1,2 ] ; Massa, M (Massa, Marco)[ 3 ] ; Riboli, E (Riboli, Elio)[ 4,5 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,APR 2020,"Humanitas Univ, Med Sch, Via Rita Levi Montalcini, I-20090 Milan, Italy.

Purpose Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19. This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. Methods The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" in conjunction with ""otorhinolaryngological manifestation"", ""ENT"", and ""olfaction"". Results The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Otolaryngological manifestations; Olfaction; ENT,文献类型:Review; Early Access,EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY,10.1007/s00405-020-05968-y,COVID-19 in otolaryngologist practice: a review of current knowledge,"作者:Krajewska, J (Krajewska, Joanna)[ 1 ] ; Krajewski, W (Krajewski, Wojciech)[ 2 ] ; Zub, K (Zub, Krzysztof)[ 1 ] ; Zatonski, T (Zatonski, Tomasz)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology,,APR 2020,"Med Univ Wroclaw, Dept & Clin Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Borowska 213 St, PL-50556 Wroclaw, Poland.

"摘要
A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016. The protein, known as RBD219-N1 when formulated on Alhydrogel (R), induced high-level neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity with minimal immunopathology in mice after a homologous virus challenge with SARS-CoV (MA15 strain). We examined published evidence in support of whether the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 could be repurposed as a heterologous vaccine against Coronavirus Infectious Disease (COVID)-19. Our findings include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a review of published studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro finds that some of these mAbs bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, while others bind to domains outside this region within RBD. This information is relevant and supports the possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine against COVID-19, especially due to the finding that the overall high amino acid similarity (82%) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not reflected in RBM amino acid similarity (59%). However, the high sequence similarity (94%) in the region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes between both viruses.",作者关键词:Heterologous vaccine; receptor-binding domain; subunit vaccine; coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS,10.1080/21645515.2020.1740560,Potential for developing a SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein as a heterologous human vaccine against coronavirus infectious disease (COVID)-19,"作者:Chen, WH (Chen, Wen-Hsiang)[ 1,2 ] ; Hotez, PJ (Hotez, Peter J.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Bottazzi, ME (Bottazzi, Maria Elena)[ 1,2,3 ]",研究方向:Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,,APR 2020,"Texas Childrens Hosp, Baylor Coll Med, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.

"摘要
The world is in the grip of a crisis that stands unprecedented in living memory. The COVID-19 pandemic is urgent, global in scale, and massive in impacts. Following Harold D. Lasswell's goal for the policy sciences to offer insights into unfolding phenomena, this commentary draws on the lessons of the policy sciences literature to understand the dynamics related to COVID-19. We explore the ways in which scientific and technical expertise, emotions, and narratives influence policy decisions and shape relationships among citizens, organizations, and governments. We discuss varied processes of adaptation and change, including learning, surges in policy responses, alterations in networks (locally and globally), implementing policies across transboundary issues, and assessing policy success and failure. We conclude by identifying understudied aspects of the policy sciences that deserve attention in the pandemic's aftermath.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Pandemic; Policy sciences; Public policy; Policy processes; Crisis,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,POLICY SCIENCES,10.1007/s11077-020-09381-4,COVID-19 and the policy sciences: initial reactions and perspectives,"作者:Weible, CM (Weible, Christopher M.)[ 1 ] ; Nohrstedt, D (Nohrstedt, Daniel)[ 2,3 ] ; Cairney, P (Cairney, Paul)[ 4 ] ; Carter, DP (Carter, David P.)[ 5 ] ; Crow, DA (Crow, Deserai A.)[ 1 ] ; Durnova, AP (Durnova, Anna P.)[ 6 ] ; Heikkila, T (Heikkila, Tanya)[ 1 ] ; Ingold, K (Ingold, Karin)[ 7,8,11 ] ; McConnell, A (McConnell, Allan)[ 9 ] ; Stone, D (Stone, Diane)[ 10 ]",研究方向:Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,APR 2020,"Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, 1380 Lawrence St, Denver, CO 80238 USA.

"摘要
Fangcang shelter hospitals are a novel public health concept. They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement). Fangcang shelter hospitals could be powerful components of national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future epidemics and public health emergencies.",,文献类型:Article,LANCET,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30744-3,Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies,"作者:Chen, SM (Chen, Simiao)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhang, ZJ (Zhang, Zongjiu)[ 4 ] ; Yang, JT (Yang, Juntao)[ 5 ] ; Wang, J (Wang, Jian)[ 6 ] ; Zhai, XH (Zhai, Xiaohui)[ 6 ] ; Barnighausen, T (Barnighausen, Till)[ 1,2,3,7 ] ; Wang, C (Wang, Chen)[ 3,8,9,10 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,出版年: APR 18 2020,"Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Bariatric patients are unique from other surgical patients due to their higher prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory illnesses. The outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has drastically changed the way bariatric surgeon's practice today. This review aims to access the best practices to treat our bariatric patient during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2020. A practice overview of one academic and one community bariatric practice along with a literature search using the PubMed data source during the COVID-19 outbreak was conducted. Following the recommendation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service and American College of Surgeons ""Guidance of Triage of Non-Emergent Surgical Procedures"" released in March of 2020, it is recommended that elective cases be postponed. However, using robust telehealth modalities including video and phone call systems, practice patterns can be modified to mitigate interruptions in patient care.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,BARIATRIC SURGICAL PRACTICE AND PATIENT CARE,10.1089/bari.2020.0022,Bariatric Surgical Practice and Patient Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"作者:Mikami, D (Mikami, Dean)[ 1 ] ; Noria, S (Noria, Sabrena)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Nursing; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, John A Burns Sch Med, Dept Surg, Tower 6th Floor,Room 607,1356 Lusitana St, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.

"摘要
With the outbreak of the COVID-19, China had to declare a public health emergency within a short time. In order to control and prevent further spread of the disease, China activated the highest emergency response level and has been implementing many draconian measures based on the Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (LPTID). However, the LPTID lacks a disability perspective and overlooks the needs of people with disabilities during emergencies to a large extent. Combining the law and disability perspectives, this article analyzes different Articles of the LPTID and points out its inadequacies regarding the emergency preparedness and response plans in the midst of a major public health crisis. Besides, the experiences of some people with disabilities being affected are shared in the article. This article calls for nations to ensure amendments of their legal frameworks regarding public health and emergency preparedness fully engage a rights-based disability perspective.",作者关键词:Disabled People; COVID-19; Emergency Preparedness; Response Plan; Quarantine; Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases; China,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DISABILITY & SOCIETY,10.1080/09687599.2020.1752622,Including people with disability in the COVID-19 outbreak emergency preparedness and response in China,"作者:Qi, F (Qi, Fei)[ 1 ] ; Hu, LJ (Hu, Luanjiao)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Rehabilitation; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,APR 2020,"Hainan Univ, Law Sch, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has caused an emergency in the health system worldwide. After a first development in Wuhan, China, the virus spread in other countries, with Italy registering the second highest number of cases in Europe on the 7th of April 2020 (135,586 in total). The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed. COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated. Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.",作者关键词:dental public health; dental education; infection control; practice management; prevention; virology,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH,UNSP 0022034520920580,COVID-19 Transmission in Dental Practice: Brief Review of Preventive Measures in Italy,"作者:Izzetti, R (Izzetti, R.)[ 1 ] ; Nisi, M (Nisi, M.)[ 1 ] ; Gabriele, M (Gabriele, M.)[ 1 ] ; Graziani, F (Graziani, F.)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",,10.1177/0022034520920580,"Univ Pisa, Dept Surg Med & Mol Pathol & Crit Care Med, Via Savi 10, I-56100 Pisa, Italy.

"摘要
Wastes generated in healthcare facilities have been discussed and the World Health Organization has proposed a guideline for controlling the spread of the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, waste management outside the generating facility should be discussed in more detail, taking into account factors such as virus resistance, differences in waste management systems and the climatic conditions in each affected region. Patients infected by human coronavirus being treated at home are generating infected waste possibly discarded as domestic waste, which can pose risks to workers and the environment, depending on the conditions of transport and disposal. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus may be increased by inadequate waste management, highlighting poor handling conditions associated with inappropriate use of personal protective equipment and other unfavourable conditions presented mainly in developing countries.",作者关键词:Coronavirus infections; medical wastes; household waste; communicable diseases; environment,文献类型:Letter; Early Access,WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH,0734242X20918312,Can the human coronavirus epidemic also spread through solid waste?,"作者:Mol, MPG (Mol, Marcos Paulo Gomes)[ 1 ] ; Caldas, S (Caldas, Sergio)",研究方向:Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,10.1177/0734242X20918312,"Ezequiel Dias Fdn, Res Dept, Conde Pereira Carneiro St 80, BR-30510010 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.

Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an incentive to expand considerably the use of telemedicine for high-risk patients with diabetes, and especially for the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Telemedicine and digital medicine also offer critically important approaches to improve access, efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of medical care for people with diabetes.

Methods: Two case reports are presented where telemedicine was used effectively and safely after day 1 in person patient education. These aspects of the management of new-onset T1D patients (adult and pediatric) included ongoing diabetes education of the patient and family digitally. The patients used continuous glucose monitoring with commercially available analysis software (Dexcom Clarity and Glooko) to generate ambulatory glucose profiles and interpretive summary reports. The adult subject used multiple daily insulin injections; the pediatric patient used an insulin pump. The subjects were managed using a combination of e-mail, Internet via Zoom, and telephone calls.

Results: These two cases show the feasibility and effectiveness of use of telemedicine in applications in which we had not used it previously: new-onset diabetes education and insulin dosage management.

Conclusions: The present case reports illustrate how telemedicine can be used safely and effectively for new-onset T1D training and education for both pediatric and adult patients and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated the expansion of the use of telemedicine and digital medicine. We conclude that telemedicine is an effective approach for the management of patients with new-onset T1D.",作者关键词:New-onset type 1 diabetes; Telemedicine; Virtual; CGM; Health economics; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DIABETES TECHNOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS,10.1089/dia.2020.0161,Managing New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Opportunities,"作者:Garg, SK (Garg, Satish K.)[ 1 ] ; Rodbard, D (Rodbard, David)[ 2 ] ; Hirsch, IB (Hirsch, Irl B.)[ 3 ] ; Forlenza, GP (Forlenza, Gregory P.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Endocrinology & Metabolism,,APR 2020,"Univ Colorado Denver, Barbara Davis Ctr Diabet, Med & Pediat, 1775 Aurora Court,Room M20-1323, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.

Background The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis and otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk of contracting COVID-19. There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for otolaryngologic surgery in the setting of COVID-19.

Methods We reviewed relevant publications and position statements regarding the management of otolaryngology patients in the setting of COVID-19. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed.

Results Enhanced personal protective equipment (N95 respirator and face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable cap and gown, gloves) is required for any otolaryngology patient with unknown, suspected, or positive COVID-19 status. Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely, and clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs.

Conclusion We summarize current best-practice recommendations for otolaryngologists to ensure safety for themselves, their clinical staff, and their patients.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; otolaryngology; PPE; SARS-CoV-2; surgery,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26162,Impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on otolaryngologic surgery: Brief commentary,"作者:Bann, DV (Bann, Darrin V.)[ 1 ] ; Patel, VA (Patel, Vijay A.)[ 1 ] ; Saadi, R (Saadi, Robert)[ 1 ] ; Gniady, JP (Gniady, John P.)[ 1 ] ; Goyal, N (Goyal, Neerav)[ 1 ] ; McGinn, JD (McGinn, Johnathan D.)[ 1 ] ; Goldenberg, D (Goldenberg, David)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 500 Univ Dr,H091, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.

2019-nCoV epidemic was firstly reported at late December of 2019 and has caused a global outbreak of COVID-19 now. Saliva, a biofluid largely generated from salivary glands in oral cavity, has been reported 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive. Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2. Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice. So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time. Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination. This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.",,文献类型:Review,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCE,11,Saliva: potential diagnostic value and transmission of 2019-nCoV,"作者:Xu, RS (Xu Ruoshi)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Cui, BM (Cui Bomiao)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Duan, XB (Duan Xiaobo)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhang, P (Zhang Ping)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Zhou, XD (Zhou Xuedong)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Yuan, Q (Yuan Quan)[ 1,2,3 ]","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",Special Funds for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 of Sichuan University ,出版年: APR 17 2020,"Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Oral Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China.

Background The clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) patients outside the epicenter of Hubei Province are less understood.

Methods We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID-2019 cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen City, China, from January 11, 2020, to February 6, 2020, and followed until March 6, 2020.

Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233 (81.5%) had been to Hubei, while 42 (14%) did not have a clear travel history. Only 218 (73.15%) cases had a fever as the initial symptom. Compared with the nonsevere cases, severe cases were associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, and higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Slower clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to critical condition. As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%.

Conclusions In a designated hospital outside Hubei Province, COVID-2019 patients could be effectively managed by properly using the existing hospital system. Mortality may be lowered when cases are relatively mild, and there are sufficient medical resources to care and treat the disease.",作者关键词:corona Virus Disease 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severe pneumonia; epidemiological features,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ALLERGY,10.1111/all.14309,"COVID-19 in a designated infectious diseases hospital outside Hubei Province, China","作者:Cai, QX (Cai, Qingxian)[ 1 ] ; Huang, DL (Huang, Deliang)[ 1 ] ; Ou, PC (Ou, Pengcheng)[ 2 ] ; Yu, H (Yu, Hong)[ 1 ] ; Zhu, ZB (Zhu, Zhibin)[ 1 ] ; Xia, Z (Xia, Zhang)[ 1 ] ; Su, YN (Su, Yinan)[ 3 ] ; Ma, ZH (Ma, Zhenghua)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, YM (Zhang, Yiming)[ 1 ] ; Li, ZW (Li, Zhiwei)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Allergy; Immunology,Gates Foundation,APR 2020,"Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Affiliated Hosp 2, Peoples Hosp Shenzhen 3, Natl Clin Res Ctr Infect Dis, Shenzhen 518100, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel type of highly contagious pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the strong efforts taken to control the epidemic, hundreds of thousands of people were infected worldwide by 11 March, and the situation was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Pregnant women are more susceptible to viral infection due to immune and anatomic alteration, though hospital visits may increase the chance of infection, the lack of medical care during pregnancy may do more harm. Hence, a well-managed system that allows pregnant women to access maternal health care with minimum exposure risk is desired during the outbreak. Here, we present the managing processes of three pregnant women who had fever during hospitalization in the gynecology or obstetrics department, and then, we further summarize and demonstrate our maternal health care management strategies including antenatal care planning, patient triage based on the risk level, admission control, and measures counteracting emergencies and newly discovered high-risk cases at in-patient department. In the meantime, we will explain the alterations we have done throughout different stages of the epidemic and also review relative articles in both Chinese and English to compare our strategies with those of other areas. Although tens of COVID-19 cases were confirmed in our hospital, no nosocomial infection has occurred and none of the pregnant women registered in our hospital was reported to be infected.",作者关键词:2019 coronavirus disease; 2019 novel coronavirus; antenatal care; health care management; maternal health; nosocomial infection; pregnant; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25787,Maternal health care management during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019,"作者:Chen, Y (Chen, Yu)[ 1 ] ; Li, Z (Li, Zhe)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, YY (Zhang, Yuan-Yuan)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, WH (Zhao, Wei-Hua)[ 3 ] ; Yu, ZY (Yu, Zhi-Ying)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee ,APR 2020,"Shenzhen Univ Hlth Sci Ctr, Affiliated Hosp 1, Shenzhen Peoples Hosp 2, Dept Gynecol, Shenzhen 518035, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Coronaviruses are common human viruses and include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses mainly bind to transmembrane receptor proteins on the human cell membrane through spike proteins (S-proteins), thus releasing the RNA of the virus into the interior of the host cell to cause an infection. In this article, we discuss the mechanism and production of cyclodextrin-soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (CD-sACE2) inclusion compounds in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections by blocking S-proteins. On the basis of the current research evidence, we believe that CD-sACE2 inclusion compounds have the potential to treat COVID-19. We hope that our article can provide a theoretical basis for later experiments.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; ACE2; coronavirus; COVID-19; cyclodextrin,文献类型:Letter; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25804,CD-sACE2 inclusion compounds: An effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"作者:Sun, PF (Sun, Pengfei)[ 1 ] ; Lu, XH (Lu, Xiaosheng)[ 2 ] ; Xu, C (Xu, Chao)[ 1 ] ; Wang, YJ (Wang, Yanjin)[ 3 ] ; Sun, WJ (Sun, Wenjuan)[ 4 ] ; Xi, JN (Xi, Jianing)[ 5 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Capital Med Univ, Beijing Rehabil Hosp, Dept Resp Rehabil, Bada Rd, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.",,文献类型:Article,CELL,10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052,SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor,"作者:Hoffmann, M (Hoffmann, Markus)[ 1 ] ; Kleine-Weber, H (Kleine-Weber, Hannah)[ 1,2 ] ; Schroeder, S (Schroeder, Simon)[ 3,4,5,6,7 ] ; Kruger, N (Krueger, Nadine)[ 8,9 ] ; Herrler, T (Herrler, Tanja)[ 10 ] ; Erichsen, S (Erichsen, Sandra)[ 11,12 ] ; Schiergens, TS (Schiergens, Tobias S.)[ 13 ] ; Herrler, G (Herrler, Georg)[ 8 ] ; Wu, NH (Wu, Nai-Huei); Nitsche, A (Nitsche, Andreas)[ 14 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),出版年: APR 16 2020,"Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr, Infect Biol Unit, Gottingen, Germany.

"摘要
The emergence of the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic called coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has become one of the most significant challenges to the healthcare profession. Dental practices are focal points for cross-infection, and care must be taken to minimise the risk of infection to, from, or between dental care professionals and patients. The COVID-19 epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children's symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience. It is unknown whether certain groups, for example children with comorbidities, might be at a higher risk of more severe illness. Emerging data on disease spread in children, affected by COVID-19, have not been presented in detail. The purpose of this article was to report current data on the paediatric population affected with COVID-19 and highlight considerations for dentists providing care for children during this pandemic. All members of the dental team have a professional responsibility to keep themselves informed of current guidance and be vigilant in updating themselves as recommendations are changing so quickly.",作者关键词:children; coronavirus; COVID-19; dentistry; paediatric dentistry,文献类型:Editorial Material,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC DENTISTRY,10.1111/ipd.12653,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Characteristics in children and considerations for dentists providing their care,"作者:Mallineni, SK (Mallineni, Sreekanth Kumar)[ 1 ] ; Innes, NP (Innes, Nicola P.)[ 2 ] ; Raggio, DP (Raggio, Daniela Procida)[ 3 ] ; Araujo, MP (Araujo, Mariana Pinheiro)[ 2 ] ; Robertson, MD (Robertson, Mark D.)[ 2 ] ; Jayaraman, J (Jayaraman, Jayakumar)[ 4 ]","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Pediatrics",,出版年: MAY 2020,"Univ Texas Hlth Sch Dent, Dept Dev Dent, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA.

"摘要
Background: In December 2019, a pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and has rapidly spread around the world since then. Aim: This study aims to understand the research gaps related to COVID-19 and propose recommendations for future research. Methods: We undertook a scoping review of COVID-19, comprehensively searching databases and other sources to identify literature on COVID-19 between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020. We analysed the sources, publication date, type and topic of the retrieved articles/studies.

Results: We included 249 articles in this scoping review. More than half (59.0%) were conducted in China. Guidance/guidelines and consensuses statements (n = 56; 22.5%) were the most common. Most (n = 192; 77.1%) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals, 35 (14.1%) on preprint servers and 22 (8.8%) posted online. Ten genetic studies (4.0%) focused on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 while the topics of molecular studies varied. Nine of 22 epidemiological studies focused on estimating the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection (R-0). Of all identified guidance/guidelines (n = 35), only ten fulfilled the strict principles of evidence-based practice. The number of articles published per day increased rapidly until the end of January.

Conclusion: The number of articles on COVID-19 steadily increased before 6 February 2020. However, they lack diversity and are almost non-existent in some study fields, such as clinical research. The findings suggest that evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies will be improved when more results from clinical research becomes available.",,文献类型:Review,EUROSURVEILLANCE,2000125,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a scoping review,"作者:Lv, M (Lv, Meng)[ 1,2 ] ; Luo, XF (Luo, Xufei)[ 1,2 ] ; Estill, J (Estill, Janne)[ 3,4 ] ; Liu, YL (Liu, Yunlan)[ 1 ] ; Ren, M (Ren, Mengjuan)[ 1 ] ; Wang, JJ (Wang, Jianjian)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, Q (Wang, Qi)[ 5 ] ; Zhao, SY (Zhao, Siya)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, XH (Wang, Xiaohui)[ 1 ] ; Yang, S (Yang, Shu)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,2020 Key R&D project of Gansu Province ,出版年: APR 16 2020,"Lanzhou Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.

"摘要
COVID-19 is an emerging viral illness that has rapidly transmitted throughout the world. Its impact on society and the health care system has compelled hospitals to quickly adapt and innovate as new information about the disease is uncovered. During this pandemic, essential medical and surgical services must be carried out while minimizing the risk of disease transmission to health care workers. There is an elevated risk of COVID-19 viral transmission to health care workers during surgical procedures of the head and neck due to potential aerosolization of viral particles from the oral cavity/naso-oropharynx mucosa. Thus, patients with facial fractures pose unique challenges to the variety of injuries and special considerations, including triaging injuries and protective measures against infection. The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Our proposed algorithm aims to balance patient care with patient/medical personnel protection as well as judicious health care utilization. It stratifies facial trauma procedures by urgency and assigns a recommended level of personal protective equipment, extreme or enhanced, incorporating current best practices and existing data on viral transmission. As this pandemic continues to evolve and more information is obtained, the protocol can be further refined and individualized to each institution.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY & AESTHETIC MEDICINE,10.1089/fpsam.2020.0185,A Guide to Facial Trauma Triage and Precautions in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"作者:Hsieh, TY (Hsieh, Tsung-yen)[ 1 ] ; Dedhia, RD (Dedhia, Raj D.)[ 2 ] ; Chiao, W (Chiao, Whitney)[ 1 ] ; Dresner, H (Dresner, Harley)[ 1 ] ; Barta, RJ (Barta, Ruth J.)[ 3 ] ; Lyford-Pike, S (Lyford-Pike, Sofia)[ 1 ] ; Hamlar, D (Hamlar, David)[ 1 ] ; Stephan, SJ (Stephan, Scott J.)[ 2 ] ; Schubert, W (Schubert, Warren)[ 3 ] ; Hilger, PA (Hilger, Peter A.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Minnesota, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Div Facial Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Phillips Wangensteen Bldg,516 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.

The pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is having a global impact unseen since the 1918 worldwide influenza epidemic. All aspects of life have changed dramatically for now. The group most susceptible to COVID-19 are older adults and those with chronic underlying medical disorders. The population residing in long-term care facilities generally are those who are both old and have multiple comorbidities. In this article we provide information, insights, and recommended approaches to COVID-19 in the long-term facility setting.

Mental health concerns of people impacted by the coronavirus pandemic have not been adequately addressed. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the properties of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), which is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis. This 5-item scale, which was based on 775 adults with anxiety over the coronavirus, demonstrated solid reliability and validity. Elevated CAS scores were found to be associated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese products. The CAS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety using an optimized cut score of >= 9 (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity). These results support the CAS as an efficient and valid tool for clinical research and practice.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DEATH STUDIES,10.1080/07481187.2020.1748481,Coronavirus anxiety scale: A brief mental health screener for COVID-19 related anxiety,"作者:Lee, SA (Lee, Sherman A.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Psychology; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,,APR 2020,"Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Psychol, 1 Ave,Arts, Newport News, VA 23606 USA.

A severe cutaneous drug reaction resembling acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis resulting from ingestion of hydroxychloroquine has been documented. It is distinguishable by its longer incubation period, more varied morphology with initially urticarial and later targetoid and arcuate plaques, recalcitrance to therapy and longer duration. Given the anticipated surge in the use of hydroxychloroquine due to its reported benefits in those with coronavirus disease 2019, specific recognition of this entity is pivotal.

"摘要
With the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) viral pandemic, there is uncertainty whether biologic agents for psoriasis may place patients at a higher risk for infection or more severe disease course. This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation. Once this pandemic has passed, it is only a matter of time before a new viral disease reignites the same issues discussed here.",作者关键词:Biologics; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Infection; Pandemic; Psoriasis; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DERMATOLOGY AND THERAPY,10.1007/s13555-020-00377-9,Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Biologic Therapy in Psoriasis: Infection Risk and Patient Counseling in Uncertain Times,"作者:Brownstone, ND (Brownstone, Nicholas D.)[ 1 ] ; Thibodeaux, QG (Thibodeaux, Quinn G.)[ 1 ] ; Reddy, VD (Reddy, Vidhatha D.)[ 1 ] ; Myers, BA (Myers, Bridget A.)[ 1 ] ; Chan, SHY (Chan, Stephanie Y.)[ 1 ] ; Bhutani, T (Bhutani, Tina)[ 1 ] ; Liao, WS (Liao, Wilson)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Dermatology,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

"摘要
Although inadequate immunization is a significant public health problem, as covid-19 is an urgent reminder, it has been largely ignored in amateur youth sports. By comparison, safety issues such as concussions have drawn extensive concern. This article examines the case for immunizing athletes who participate in amateur sports for youth. It begins with risks of transmission and current gaps in addressing immunization of amateur athletes. It then considers arguments for immunization, along with objections to immunization requirements for participation. The article concludes that amateur youth sports organizations must pay far more attention to immunization than they currently do, have published policies about immunization, inform participants of these policies, and educate athletes, coaches, and officials about contagion risks.",作者关键词:Immunization; amateur sports; measles; influenza; contagion; covid-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPORT,10.1080/00948705.2020.1750960,Immunization and participation in amateur youth sports,"作者:Francis, J (Francis, John)[ 1 ] ; Francis, L (Francis, Leslie)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sport Sciences,,APR 2020,"Univ Utah, Polit Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.

Background: Most secondary transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in a hospital setting. To decrease person-to-person contact, health care providers have built many isolation wards. However, out-of-hospital professionals cannot access patient information, which has greatly reduced the efficiency of treatment; it is inconvenient for health care professionals to issue a case discussion with professionals from other wards. This article mainly introduces a mobile telehealth system (MTS) applied to facilitate patient information presentation and case discussion.

Materials and Methods: The MTS searches patient information, which is stored in hospital intranet, and uses five modules to display patient information. By a request/response module and a real-time interaction module, we successfully conducted case discussions. In addition, we took measures in three areas to prevent patient information leakage.

Results: The system uses mobile collaboration technology to present patient information and support case discussion. MTS was officially launched for 37 days, during which it has been used 3,061 times.

Conclusions: The building of the MTS not only provides convenience and benefit for health care professionals, but also reduces person-to-person contact.",作者关键词:telemedicine; telehealth; COVID-19; mobility; patient information; case discussion,文献类型:Article; Early Access,TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,10.1089/tmj.2020.0084,The Application of Mobile Telehealth System to Facilitate Patient Information Presentation and Case Discussion,"作者:Ren, XY (Ren, Xiaoyang)[ 1 ] ; Zhai, YK (Zhai, Yunkai)[ 2 ] ; Song, XQ (Song, Xiaoqin)[ 3 ] ; Wang, ZB (Wang, Zhenbo)[ 2 ] ; Dou, DW (Dou, Dongwei)[ 4 ] ; Li, YH (Li, Yuhong)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,,APR 2020,"Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Informat, Zhengzhou 450052, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In this paper are presented mathematical predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the COVID-19 pandemic based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss error function, with four parameters, as a cumulative distribution function. We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities. Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs, medical, social distancing, virological and epidemiological) or models of contamination diffusion.",,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS,10.1140/epjp/s13360-020-00383-y,Mathematical prediction of the time evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy by a Gauss error function and Monte Carlo simulations,"作者:Ciufolini, I (Ciufolini, Ignazio)[ 1,2 ] ; Paolozzi, A (Paolozzi, Antonio)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Physics,,出版年: APR 15 2020,"Univ Salento, Dipartimento Ingn Innovaz, Lecce, Italy.

"摘要
The World Health Organization has not only signaled the health risks of COVID-19, but also labeled the situation as infodemic, due to the amount of information, true and false, circulating around this topic. Research shows that, in social media, falsehood is shared far more than evidence-based information. However, there is less research analyzing the circulation of false and evidence-based information during health emergencies. Thus, the present study aims at shedding new light on the type of tweets that circulated on Twitter around the COVID-19 outbreak for two days, in order to analyze how false and true information was shared. To that end, 1000 tweets have been analyzed. Results show that false information is tweeted more but retweeted less than science-based evidence or fact-checking tweets, while science-based evidence and fact-checking tweets capture more engagement than mere facts. These findings bring relevant insights to inform public health policies.",作者关键词:Communicative content analysis; coronavirus; infodemic; social media; social media analytics; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY,0268580920914755,COVID-19 infodemic: More retweets for science-based information on coronavirus than for false information,"作者:Pulido, CM (Pulido, Cristina M.)[ 1 ] ; Villarejo-Carballido, B (Villarejo-Carballido, Beatriz)[ 2 ] ; Redondo-Sama, G (Redondo-Sama, Gisela)[ 3 ] ; Gomez, A (Gomez, Aitor)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Sociology,Catalan Agency for Management of University and Research Grants ,10.1177/0268580920914755,"Univ Deusto, Fac Social & Human Sci, Ctr Appl Eth, Ave Univ 24, Bilbao 48007, Spain.

I wrote this as a narrative piece for school, but it is a very honest description of how I'm feeling at this time. I just wanted to reassure people that I am ok. For anyone else who is feeling the same as I am, it's ok. I think it is good for us to be honest about how we are feeling, and it is perfectly reasonable for us to feel confusion during this time. I also think it is good for us to not let any anxiety overwhelm us. So let it out. Talk to someone. Write it down. And breathe.

"摘要
Background: Throughout China, during the recent epidemic in Hubei province, frontline medical staff have been responsible for tracing contacts of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020.

Material/Methods: A cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 0-3). The chi-squared chi(2) test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender.

Results: Study questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff. The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours. Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID-19 infection. The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit.

Conclusions: The COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province. Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that may encourage medical staff to work during future epidemics.","作者关键词:Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Medical Staff; Stress, Psychological; COVID-19",文献类型:Article,MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,e924171,"Psychological Impact and Coping Strategies of Frontline Medical Staff in Hunan Between January and March 2020 During the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China","作者:Cai, HZ (Cai, Haozheng)[ 1 ] ; Tu, BR (Tu, Baoren)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ma, J (Ma, Jing)[ 4 ] ; Chen, LM (Chen, Limin)[ 5 ] ; Fu, L (Fu, Lei)[ 6 ] ; Jiang, YF (Jiang, Yongfang)[ 4 ] ; Zhuang, Q (Zhuang, Quan)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: APR 15 2020,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 3, Transplantat Ctr, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide. As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside. Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general. This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including in vitro model systems, vaccine technology, and small-molecule drug delivery. COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need.

Impact statement

Given the steep mortality caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks. Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks. Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for technological translation from benchtop to bedside. In this work, three areas pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted.",作者关键词:tissue engineering; biomaterials; pandemic; coronavirus; viral,文献类型:Article; Early Access,TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A,10.1089/ten.tea.2020.0094,Role of Tissue Engineering in COVID-19 and Future Viral Outbreaks,"作者:Tatara, AM (Tatara, Alexander M.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Cell Biology; Engineering; Materials Science,,APR 2020,"Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.

"摘要
Almost the entire world, not only China, is currently experiencing the outbreak of a novel coronavirus that causes respiratory disease, severe pneumonia, and even death. The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and is currently still ongoing. This novel coronavirus is highly contagious and has resulted in a continuously increasing number of infections and deaths that have already surpassed the SARS-CoV outbreak that occurred in China between 2002 and 2003. It is now officially a pandemic, announced by WHO on the 11th of March. Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial. Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency. Key Points center dot In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health. center dot Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians. center dot Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Pneumonia; Diagnostic imaging; Multidetector computed tomography; Mass chest X-ray,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00330-020-06827-4,The role of imaging in 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19),"作者:Yang, WJ (Yang, Wenjing)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Sirajuddin, A (Sirajuddin, Arlene)[ 4 ] ; Zhang, XC (Zhang, Xiaochun)[ 3 ] ; Liu, GS (Liu, Guanshu)[ 5 ] ; Teng, ZZ (Teng, Zhongzhao)[ 6,7 ] ; Zhao, SH (Zhao, Shihua)[ 1 ] ; Lu, MJ (Lu, Minjie)[ 1,4,8 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Construction of Key Laboratory (Cultivation) of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences ,APR 2020,"Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Fuwai Hosp, Natl Ctr Cardiovasc Dis, Dept Magnet Resonance Imaging, 167 Beilishi Rd, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Given the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to divulge all the available technologies with the potential to fight against this virus. Plant biotechnology offers potential solutions to this pandemic through the development of low-cost vaccines and antibodies useful for therapy, prophylaxis, and diagnosis. The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical trials with encouraging results. Thus far, some companies have started developing anti-COVID-19 antibodies and vaccines. In particular, plant-made antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks. The key aspects that will define the exploitation of this technology in the fight against COVID-19 are discussed.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2 virus; plantibody; biomanufacturing; COVID-19 vaccine; mucosal immunization,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,EXPERT OPINION ON BIOLOGICAL THERAPY,10.1080/14712598.2020.1752177,Will plant-made biopharmaceuticals play a role in the fight against COVID-19?,"作者:Rosales-Mendoza, S (Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,APR 2020,"Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Ciencias Quim, Ave Dr Manuel Nava 6, San Luis Potosi 78210, San Luis Potosi, Mexico.

"摘要
COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response toward social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the influence of information (formal and informal) sources on situational awareness of the public for adopting health-protective behaviors such as social distancing. For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources, formal (P = .001) and informal (P = 0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness, P = .000. It can, therefore, be concluded that an increase in situational awareness in times of public health crisis using formal information sources can significantly increase the adoption of protective health behavior and in turn contain the spread of infectious diseases.",作者关键词:COVID-19; information sources; situational awareness; social distancing,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25840,Analyzing situational awareness through public opinion to predict adoption of social distancing amid pandemic COVID-19,"作者:Qazi, A (Qazi, Atika)[ 1 ] ; Qazi, J (Qazi, Javaria)[ 2 ] ; Naseer, K (Naseer, Khulla)[ 2 ] ; Zeeshan, M (Zeeshan, Muhammad)[ 3 ] ; Hardaker, G (Hardaker, Glenn)[ 1 ] ; Maitama, JZ (Maitama, Jaafar Zubairu)[ 4 ] ; Haruna, K (Haruna, Khalid)[ 5 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Univ Brunei Darussalam, Ctr Lifelong Learning, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei.

"摘要
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raging across the world. The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.",作者关键词:coronavirus disease 2019; radiomics; pneumonia; diagnosis,文献类型:Article,SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES,172103,CT radiomics can help screen the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a preliminary study,"作者:Fang, MJ (Fang, Mengjie)[ 1,2 ] ; He, BX (He, Bingxi)[ 3 ] ; Li, L (Li, Li)[ 4 ] ; Dong, D (Dong, Di)[ 1,2 ] ; Yang, X (Yang, Xin)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, C (Li, Cong)[ 1,2 ] ; Meng, LW (Meng, Lingwei)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhong, LZ (Zhong, Lianzhen)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, HL (Li, Hailin)[ 5 ] ; Li, HJ (Li, Hongjun)[ 4 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Computer Science; Engineering,National Key R&D Program of China ,出版年: APR 15 2020,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, CAS Key Lab Mol Imaging, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Objectives To delineate the evolution of CT findings in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. CT features including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities were analyzed on per-patient basis during each of five time intervals spanning the 3 weeks after disease onset. Total severity scores were calculated. Results Of patients, 85.2% had travel history to Wuhan or known contact with infected individuals. The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average 5 days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that are (1) pure GGO, (2) mixed attenuation, (3) mixed attenuation with linear opacities, (4) consolidation with linear opacities, and (5) pure consolidation. The majority of patients had involvement of >= 3 lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased. Total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first 2 weeks. Conclusions While bilateral GGO are predominant features, CT findings changed during different time intervals in the 3 weeks after symptom onset in patients with COVID-19.",作者关键词:Tomography; Coronavirus; Pneumonia,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00330-020-06823-8,Evolution of CT findings in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia,"作者:Liang, T (Liang, Ting)[ 1 ] ; Liu, Z (Liu, Zhe)[ 1 ] ; Wu, CC (Wu, Carol C.)[ 2 ] ; Jin, C (Jin, Chao)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, HF (Zhao, Huifang)[ 1 ] ; Wang, Y (Wang, Yan)[ 1 ] ; Wang, ZK (Wang, Zekun)[ 3 ] ; Li, F (Li, Fen)[ 3 ] ; Zhou, J (Zhou, Jie)[ 4 ] ; Cai, SB (Cai, Shubo)[ 4 ] ...更多内容","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",National Key Research and Development Program of China ,APR 2020,"Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiol, Xian 710061, Peoples R China.

The development of COVID-19 syndrome in anticoagulated patients, and especially their admission to intensive-care units with acute severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), expose them to specific problems related to their therapy, in addition to those associated with the acute viral infection. Patients on VKA hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 show high instability of PT INR due to the variability of vitamin K metabolism, diet, fasting, co-medications, liver impairment, and heart failure. Patients on DOAC are exposed to under/over treatment caused by significant pharmacological interferences. In consideration of the pharmacological characteristics of oral anticoagulant drugs, the multiple pharmacological interactions due to the treatment of acute disease and the possible necessity of mechanical ventilation with hospitalization in intensive-care units, we suggest replacing oral anticoagulant therapies (VKA and DOAC) with parenteral heparin to avoid the risk of over/under treatment.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; VKA; DOAC; LMWH,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE,10.1007/s11739-020-02331-1,Switch from oral anticoagulants to parenteral heparin in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized patients,"作者:Testa, S (Testa, Sophie)[ 1 ] ; Paoletti, O (Paoletti, Oriana)[ 1 ] ; Giorgi-Pierfranceschi, M (Giorgi-Pierfranceschi, Matteo)[ 2 ] ; Pan, A (Pan, Angelo)[ 3 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,APR 2020,"Cremona Hosp, Haemostasis & Thrombosis Ctr, Viale Concordia 1, I-26100 Cremona, Italy.

"摘要
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After its first occurrence in Wuhan of China from December 2019, COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world. According to the World Health Organization statement on 13 March 2020, there had been over 132 500 confirmed cases globally. Nevertheless, the case reports of children are rare, which results in the lack of evidence for preventing and controlling of children's infection. Here, we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected children diagnosed from 3 February to 17 February 2020 in Tianjin, China. All of these three cases experienced mild illness and recovered soon after the treatment, with the nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative within 14, 11, and 7 days after diagnosis, respectively. However, after been discharged, all three cases were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the stool samples within 10 days, in spite of their remained negative nucleic acid in throat swab specimens. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for children cases.",作者关键词:children; clinical characteristics; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25795,Detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in feces of three children during recovery period of COVID-19 pneumonia,"作者:Zhang, TQ (Zhang, Tongqiang)[ 1,2 ] ; Cui, XJ (Cui, Xiaojian)[ 3 ] ; Zhao, X (Zhao, Xue)[ 4 ] ; Wang, JH (Wang, Jinhu)[ 5 ] ; Zheng, JF (Zheng, Jiafeng)[ 1 ] ; Zheng, GF (Zheng, Guifen)[ 6 ] ; Guo, W (Guo, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Cai, CQ (Cai, Chunquan)[ 7 ] ; He, SJ (He, Sijia)[ 8 ] ; Xu, YS (Xu, Yongsheng)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,Program of Tianjin Science and Technology Plan ,APR 2020,"Tianjin Univ, Dept Resp, Childrens Hosp Tianjin, Childrens Hosp, 238 Longyan Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background Surgeons urgently need guidance on how to deliver surgical services safely and effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to identify the key domains that should be considered when developing pandemic preparedness plans for surgical services.

Methods A scoping search was conducted to identify published articles relating to management of surgical patients during pandemics. Key informant interviews were conducted with surgeons and anaesthetists with direct experience of working during infectious disease outbreaks, in order to identify key challenges and solutions to delivering effective surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results Thirteen articles were identified from the scoping search, and surgeons and anaesthetists representing 11 territories were interviewed. To mount an effective response to COVID-19, a pandemic response plan for surgical services should be developed in advance. Key domains that should be included are: provision of staff training (such as patient transfers, donning and doffing personal protection equipment, recognizing and managing COVID-19 infection); support for the overall hospital response to COVID-19 (reduction in non-urgent activities such as clinics, endoscopy, non-urgent elective surgery); establishment of a team-based approach for running emergency services; and recognition and management of COVID-19 infection in patients treated as an emergency and those who have had surgery. A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes.

Conclusion Hospitals should prepare detailed context-specific pandemic preparedness plans addressing the identified domains. Specific guidance should be updated continuously to reflect emerging evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,文献类型:Review; Early Access,BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY,10.1002/bjs.11646,Global guidance for surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic,团体作者: COVIDSurg Collaborative,研究方向:Surgery,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR),APR 2020,

"摘要
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic spreads rapidly worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused mildly to seriously and fatally respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In this study, we detected and analyzed the main laboratory indicators related to heart injury, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), myohemoglobin (MYO), cardiac troponin I (ultra-TnI), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), in 273 patients with COVID-19 and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease. It was found that higher concentration in venous blood of CK-MB, MYO, ultra-TnI, and NT-proBNP were associated with the severity and case fatality rate of COVID-19.

"摘要
The recent pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is unarguably the most fearsome compared with the earlier outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein, in turn, lead to the cross-species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2 may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modeling. The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively. Despite strong overall structural similarities, the spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared with the wild-type molecule. Most ACE2 variants showed a similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild-type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein. In summary, our data provide a structural basis of potential resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by ACE2 allelic variants.",作者关键词:ACE2; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; spike protein,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25832,Structural variations in human ACE2 may influence its binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"作者:Hussain, M (Hussain, Mushtaq)[ 1 ] ; Jabeen, N (Jabeen, Nusrat)[ 2 ] ; Raza, F (Raza, Fozia)[ 1 ] ; Shabbir, S (Shabbir, Sanya)[ 1,2 ] ; Baig, AA (Baig, Ayesha A.)[ 1 ] ; Amanullah, A (Amanullah, Anusha)[ 1 ] ; Aziz, B (Aziz, Basma)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Dow Univ Hlth Sci, Dow Coll Biotechnol, Bioinformat & Mol Med Res Grp, Karachi, Pakistan.

"摘要
Background: During February 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hubei Province, China, was at its height, requiring isolation of the population. This study aimed to compare the emotional state, somatic responses, sleep quality, and behavior of people in Hubei Province with non-endemic provinces in China during two weeks in February 2020.

Material/Methods: Questionnaires were completed by 939 individuals (357 men; 582 women), including 33 from Hubei and 906 from non-endemic provinces. The Stress Response Questionnaire (SRQ) determined the emotional state, somatic responses, and behavior. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration of sleep and sleep quality.

Results: There were 939 study participants, aged 18-24 years (35.89%) and 25-39 years (35.57%); 65.92% were university students. During a two week period in February 2020, the emotional state and behavior of participants in Hubei improved, but the quality of sleep did not. Health workers and business people became increasingly anxious, but other professionals became less anxious. The data showed that most people in Hubei Province developed a more positive attitude regarding their risk of infection and the chances of surviving the COVID-19 epidemic.

Conclusions: During a two-week period, front-line health workers and people in Hubei Province became less anxious about the COVID-19 epidemic, but sleep quality did not improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine. Therefore, health education should be combined with psychological counseling for vulnerable individuals.","作者关键词:Comparative; Study; Coronavirus; Mental Health; Stress, Psychological",文献类型:Article,MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,e923767,Comparison of the Indicators of Psychological Stress in the Population of Hubei Province and Non-Endemic Provinces in China During Two Weeks During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in February 2020,"作者:Yuan, S (Yuan, Shuai)[ 1,2 ] ; Liao, ZX (Liao, Zhenxin)[ 1,3 ] ; Huang, HJ (Huang, Haojie)[ 1,2 ] ; Jiang, BY (Jiang, Boyue)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhang, XY (Zhang, Xueyan)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, YW (Wang, Yingwen)[ 1,3 ] ; Zhao, MY (Zhao, Mingyi)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: APR 15 2020,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 3, Dept Pediat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and modeled COVID-19 infectiousness profiles from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 25-69%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases' presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission.

"摘要
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious zoonosis produced by SARS-CoV-2 that is spread human-to-human by respiratory secretions. It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.",作者关键词:contamination; COVID-19; head neck; otolaryngology; risk of contamination; surgery,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK,10.1002/hed.26164,COVID-19 pandemic: Effects and evidence-based recommendations for otolaryngology and head and neck surgery practice,"作者:Kowalski, LP (Kowalski, Luiz P.)[ 1,2 ] ; Sanabria, A (Sanabria, Alvaro)[ 3 ] ; Ridge, JA (Ridge, John A.)[ 4 ] ; Ng, WT (Ng, Wai Tong)[ 5 ] ; de Bree, R (de Bree, Remco)[ 6 ] ; Rinaldo, A (Rinaldo, Alessandra)[ 7 ] ; Takes, RP (Takes, Robert P.)[ 8 ] ; Makitie, AA (Makitie, Antti A.)[ 9,10,11,12,13 ] ; Carvalho, AL (Carvalho, Andre L.)[ 14 ] ; Bradford, CR (Bradford, Carol R.)[ 15 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Sao Paulo, Med Sch, Rua Eneas Carvalho Aguiar 255,Room 8174, BR-05402000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

"摘要
Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6), emerged as an alternative treatment for COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms recently. In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed. Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Two of them were moderately ill, six were seriously ill and seven were critically ill. The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone in eight patients. Five patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four patients who failed treatment. TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, the repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended.",作者关键词:COVID-19; cytokine storms; interleukin-6; SARS-CoV-2; Tocilizumab,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25801,Tocilizumab treatment in COVID-19: A single center experience,"作者:Luo, P (Luo, Pan)[ 1 ] ; Liu, Y (Liu, Yi)[ 1 ] ; Qiu, L (Qiu, Lin)[ 1 ] ; Liu, XL (Liu, Xiulan)[ 1 ] ; Liu, D (Liu, Dong)[ 1 ] ; Li, J (Li, Juan)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Pharm, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

"摘要
A severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was identified in December 2019 (COVID-19), spread rapidly and has become a world-wide public health challenge. About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); Inflammatory storm; IL-6; Tocilizumab,文献类型:Editorial Material,JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,164,Why tocilizumab could be an effective treatment for severe COVID-19?,"作者:Fu, BQ (Fu, Binqing)[ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ; Xu, XL (Xu, Xiaoling)[ 5 ] ; Wei, HM (Wei, Haiming)[ 1,2,3,4,5 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: APR 14 2020,"Univ Sci & Technol China, Inst Immunol, Hefei 230001, Anhui, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unfolded with remarkable speed, posing unprecedented challenges for health care systems and society. Otolaryngologists have a special role in responding to this crisis by virtue of expertise in airway management. Against the backdrop of nations struggling to contain the virus's spread and to manage hospital strain, otolaryngologists must partner with anesthesiologists and front-line health care teams to provide expert services in high-risk situations while reducing transmission. Airway management and airway endoscopy, whether awake or sedated, expose operators to infectious aerosols, posing risks to staff. This commentary provides background on the outbreak, highlights critical considerations around mitigating infectious aerosol contact, and outlines best practices for airway-related clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. What otolaryngologists need to know and what actions are required are considered alongside the implications of increasing demand for tracheostomy. Approaches to managing the airway are presented, emphasizing safety of patients and the health care team.",作者关键词:COVID-19; coronavirus disease; airway management; difficult airway; intubation; tracheostomy; infection; patient safety; quality improvement,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820919751,COVID-19 Pandemic: What Every Otolaryngologist-Head and Neck Surgeon Needs to Know for Safe Airway Management,"作者:Balakrishnan, K (Balakrishnan, Karthik)[ 1 ] ; Schechtman, S (Schechtman, Samuel)[ 2 ] ; Hogikyan, ND (Hogikyan, Norman D.)[ 3,4 ] ; Teoh, AYB (Teoh, Anthony Y.

"摘要
More than half of COVID-19 patients are afebrile early in the disease course, yet mildly ill or asymptomatic patients can still spread SARS-CoV-2 with high efficiency. Atypically presenting patients may be seen in noninfectious disease settings such as otolaryngology, which is a specialty prone to occupational exposure. Otolaryngologists have been infected with COVID-19 at higher rates than other specialties in China and other countries. Otolaryngology providers should maintain high clinical suspicion for mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Protective strategies should be implemented including preappointment screening, triaging, restriction of nonurgent visits and surgeries, telemedicine, and appropriate personal protective equipment use.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV; coronavirus; health care worker protection,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820920649,Otolaryngology Providers Must Be Alert for Patients with Mild and Asymptomatic COVID-19,"作者:Cheng, XT (Cheng, Xiaoting)[ 1,2 ] ; Liu, JL (Liu, Jialin)[ 3 ] ; Li, N (Li, Ning)[ 4 ] ; Nisenbaum, E (Nisenbaum, Eric)[ 5 ] ; Sun, Q (Sun, Qing)[ 6 ] ; Chen, B (Chen, Bing)[ 1,2 ] ; Casiano, R (Casiano, Roy)[ 5 ] ; Weed, D (Weed, Donald)[ 5 ] ; Telischi, F (Telischi, Fred)[ 5 ] ; Denneny, JC (Denneny, James C., III)[ 7 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,10.1177/0194599820920649,"Fudan Univ, ENT Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The 2019 novel coronavirus is a non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae-Nidovirales family. We examined the swings in purchase behavior following the outbreak of the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and across the world based on the theory of fear appeal. We gathered published statistics (suspected, confirmed, and fatality) on the COVID-19 alongside the purchase of personal protective equipment to examine the swings in online purchase behavior. With a serial mediated analysis, we established that fear appeal is associated with the sharp dynamics in the online purchase as related to the COVID-19. The results confirmed that fear appeal promotes social presence in anticipation of seeking affection, acceptance, and social information. This feeling is a precondition for developing e-loyalty, which promotes purchase behavior. Even though our variables might not be conclusive enough, we believe the findings are fundamental to understanding the swings in the purchase trend in this and any similar situations.",作者关键词:COVID-19; fear appeal; personal protective equipment; e-loyalty; social presence,文献类型:Article; Early Access,SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL,10.1080/02642069.2020.1751823,COVID-19: fear appeal favoring purchase behavior towards personal protective equipment COVID-19 ((sic)& x51a0;& x80ba;& x708e;): & x6050;& x60e7;(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)& x8d39;(sic)(sic)(sic)& x9632;(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic),"作者:Addo, PC (Addo, Prince Clement)[ 1,2 ] ; Fang, JM (Fang Jiaming)[ 1 ] ; Kulbo, NB (Kulbo, Nora Bakabbey)[ 1 ] ; Li, LQ (Li Liangqiang)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Business & Economics,,APR 2020,"Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus resulting in high mortality in the adult population but low mortality in the pediatric population. The role children and adolescents play in COVID-19 transmission is unclear, and it is possible that healthy pediatric patients serve as a reservoir for the virus. This article serves as a summary of a single pediatric institution's response to COVID-19 with the goal of protecting both patients and health care providers while providing ongoing care to critically ill patients who require urgent interventions. A significant limitation of this commentary is that it reflects a single institution's joint effort at a moment in time but does not take into consideration future circumstances that could change practice patterns. We still hope dissemination of our overall response at this moment, approximately 8 weeks after our region's first adult case, may benefit other pediatric institutions preparing for COVID-19.",作者关键词:pediatric otolaryngology; COVID-19; preparatory response; endoscopy,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820919748,Pediatric Otolaryngology Divisional and Institutional Preparatory Response at Seattle Children's Hospital after COVID-19 Regional Exposure,"作者:Parikh, SR (Parikh, Sanjay R.)[ 1,2 ] ; Bly, RA (Bly, Randall A.)[ 1,2 ] ; Bonilla-Velez, J (Bonilla-Velez, Juliana)[ 1,2 ] ; Dahl, JP (Dahl, John P.)[ 1,2 ] ; Evans, SS (Evans, Sean S.)[ 1,2 ] ; Horn, DL (Horn, David L.)[ 1,2 ] ; Johnson, KE (Johnson, Kaalan E.)[ 1,2 ] ; Manning, SC (Manning, Scott C.)[ 1,2 ] ; Ou, HC (Ou, Henry C.)[ 1,2 ] ; Pattisapu, P (Pattisapu, Prasanth)[ 1,2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,10.1177/0194599820919748,"Seattle Childrens Hosp, Div Pediat Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, POB 5371, Seattle, WA 98145 USA.

"摘要
There are insufficient data regarding the safety of otologic procedures in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Given the proclivity for respiratory pathogens to involve the middle ear and the significant aerosolization associated with many otologic procedures, safety precautions should follow current recommendations for procedures involving the upper airway. Until preoperative diagnostic testing becomes standardized and readily available, elective cases should be deferred and emergent/urgent cases should be treated as high risk for COVID-19 exposure. Necessary otologic procedures on positive, suspected, or unknown COVID-19 status patients should be performed using enhanced personal protective equipment, including an N95 respirator and eye protection or powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR, preferred), disposable cap, disposable gown, and gloves. Powered instrumentation should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and if performed, PAPR or sealed eye protection is recommended.",作者关键词:COVID-19; coronavirus; otology; exposure; safety precautions,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820919741,A Commentary on Safety Precautions for Otologic Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"作者:Saadi, RA (Saadi, Robert A.)[ 1 ] ; Bann, DV (Bann, Darrin V.)[ 1 ] ; Patel, VA (Patel, Vijay A.)[ 1 ] ; Goldenberg, D (Goldenberg, David)[ 1 ] ; May, J (May, Jason)[ 1 ] ; Isildak, H (Isildak, Huseyin)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,10.1177/0194599820919741,"Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 500 Univ Dr,H091, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.

"摘要
SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, first emerged in late 2019 in China. It has since infected more than 870,000 individuals and causedmore than 43,000 deaths globally. Here, we discuss therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges. Vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pandemic. Nevertheless, critical lessons can be learned for the development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be essential to reducing morbidity and mortality if the virus establishes itself in the population.",,文献类型:Review,IMMUNITY,10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Status Report,"作者:Amanat, F (Amanat, Fatima)[ 1,2 ] ; Krammer, F (Krammer, Florian)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Immunology,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVIC) contract ,出版年: APR 14 2020,"Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10029 USA.

Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world resulting in an acute respiratory illness pandemic. The majority of patients presents with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, about 5% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment. Acute hypoxemic failure with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (>30/min) usually leads to ICU admission. At that point, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen. Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date there is no specific treatment available-the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Early intubation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be avoided where possible and carried out with utmost precaution.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Coronavirus; Acute respiratory failure; ARDS; High-flow nasal cannula,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK-INTENSIVMEDIZIN UND NOTFALLMEDIZIN,10.1007/s00063-020-00689-w,German recommendations for critically ill patients with COVID-19,"作者:Kluge, S (Kluge, Stefan)[ 1,2,5,6 ] ; Janssens, U (Janssens, Uwe)[ 1,2,5 ] ; Welte, T (Welte, Tobias)[ 3,5 ] ; Weber-Carstens, S (Weber-Carstens, Steffen)[ 4,5 ] ; Marx, G (Marx, Gernot)[ 2,4,5 ] ; Karagiannidis, C (Karagiannidis, Christian)[ 1,2,5 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,APR 2020,"Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Intens Care, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.

"摘要
Data on pathologic changes of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are scarce. To gain knowledge about the pathology that may contribute to disease progression and fatality, we performed postmortem needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients' ages ranged from 59 to 81, including three males and one female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia. Histologically, the main findings are in the lungs, including injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, all components of diffuse alveolar damage. Consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces is evident. In one patient, the consolidation consists of abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. The liver exhibits mild lobular infiltration by small lymphocytes, and centrilobular sinusoidal dilation. Patchy necrosis is also seen. The heart shows only focal mild fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, changes likely related to the underlying conditions. In conclusion, the postmortem examinations show advanced diffuse alveolar damage, as well as superimposed bacterial pneumonia in some patients. Changes in the liver and heart are likely secondary or related to the underlying diseases.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MODERN PATHOLOGY,10.1038/s41379-020-0536-x,Pathological study of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through postmortem core biopsies,"作者:Tian, SF (Tian Sufang)[ 1 ] ; Xiong, Y (Xiong Yong)[ 2 ] ; Liu, H (Liu Huan)[ 1 ] ; Niu, L (Niu Li)[ 1 ] ; Guo, JC (Guo Jianchun)[ 1 ] ; Liao, MY (Liao Meiyan)[ 3 ] ; Xiao, SY (Xiao Shu-Yuan)[ 1,4 ]",研究方向:Pathology,,APR 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Dept Pathol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in the throat swab sample of one patient. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, COVID-19 has spread widely around the world, affecting more than seventy countries. China, with a huge burden of this disease, has taken strong measures to control the spread and improve the curative rate of COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. A comprehensive understanding will help to control the disease.",作者关键词:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; Coronavirus disease 2019; Epidemiology; Clinical; Pathology; Treatment,文献类型:Review; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1007/s10096-020-03874-z,The epidemiology and clinical information about COVID-19,"作者:Ge, HP (Ge, Huipeng)[ 1 ] ; Wang, XF (Wang, Xiufen)[ 1 ] ; Yuan, XN (Yuan, Xiangning)[ 1 ] ; Xiao, G (Xiao, Gong)[ 1 ] ; Wang, CZ (Wang, Chengzhi)[ 1 ] ; Deng, TC (Deng, Tianci)[ 1 ] ; Yuan, QJ (Yuan, Qiongjing)[ 1 ] ; Xiao, XC (Xiao, Xiangcheng)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Xiangya Rd 87, Changsha 41008, Hunan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
A serious epidemic of COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread to other Chinese cities and several countries now. As the majority of patients infected with COVID-19 had chest CT abnormality, chest CT has become an important tool for early diagnosis of COVID-19 and monitoring disease progression. There is growing evidence that children are also susceptible to COVID-19 and have atypical presentations compared with adults. This review is mainly about the differences in clinical symptom spectrum, diagnosis of COVID-19, and CT imaging findings between adults and children, while highlighting the value of radiology in prevention and control of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Pneumonia; viral; Tomography; spiral computed,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00330-020-06860-3,CT features of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in children,"作者:Duan, YN (Duan, Ya-ni)[ 1 ] ; Zhu, YQ (Zhu, Yan-qiu)[ 1 ] ; Tang, LL (Tang, Lei-lei)[ 1 ] ; Qin, J (Qin, Jie)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Radiol, Affiliated Hosp 3, Lingnan Hosp, 2693 Kaichuang Ave, Guangzhou 510760, Peoples R China.

Objectives: The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious threat to public health and social distancing on the part of individuals can help contain the epidemic. It is unknown if dermatologists are assisting with the public health officials' recommendations for social distancing by closing their practice or limiting their practice to the treatment of emergency conditions. This study examines the activity level of dermatology practices during the United States COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We performed scripted phone calls to 60 dermatology practices in six different counties in the United Stated during the COVID-19 outbreak. We assessed if practices are open and if they are serving patients with urgent and non-urgent conditions. Results: Of the 60 dermatologists selected for the study, 55 were successfully contacted (92% contact rate). Of these practices, 29 (53%) were open, 17 (31%) were only seeing urgent patients and 9 (16%) were closed. New York, New York had 2 (20%) open offices which was the lowest proportion of any county (p = .04). Counties with higher prevalence had fewer open offices (p < .01, R-2 = .7). Conclusions: Many practices have restricted their level of operation especially in higher areas of COVID-19 prevalence, likely to help facilitate social distancing.",作者关键词:Public health; spread; epidemic; pandemic,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL TREATMENT,10.1080/09546634.2020.1750556,An assessment of United States dermatology practices during the COVID-19 outbreak,"作者:Muddasani, S (Muddasani, Suraj)[ 1 ] ; Housholder, A (Housholder, Anne)[ 2 ] ; Fleischer, AB (Fleischer, Alan B.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Dermatology,,APR 2020,"Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.

Aim The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people. Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare.

Methods A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020.

Results The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.

Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults. Deaths were extremely rare.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; children; coronavirus; COVID-19; newborn; SARS-CoV2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ACTA PAEDIATRICA,10.1111/apa.15270,Systematic review of COVID-19 in children shows milder cases and a better prognosis than adults,"作者:Ludvigsson, JF (Ludvigsson, Jonas F.)[ 1,2,3,4 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,,APR 2020,"Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.

Since its outbreak in December 2019 in China, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread and affected several countries. It has resulted in a difficult situation for cancer patients owing to the risks of the epidemic situation outbreak as well as cancer. Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID-19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment. Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China and the world. Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment-related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns.",作者关键词:COVID-19; lung neoplasms; therapeutics,文献类型:Article; Early Access,THORACIC CANCER,10.1111/1759-7714.13424,Recommendations of individualized medical treatment and common adverse events management for lung cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic,"作者:Zhao, Z (Zhao, Zhe)[ 1 ] ; Bai, H (Bai, Hua)[ 1 ] ; Duan, JC (Duan, Jianchun)[ 1 ] ; Wang, J (Wang, Jie)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Respiratory System,National key research and development project ,APR 2020,"Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Dept Med Oncol, Natl Canc Ctr, Natl Clin Res Ctr Canc,Canc Hosp, 17 Pan Jia Yuan S Ln, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Purpose of Review Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the aggressive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. Recent Findings Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12% of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-COV 2; ACEI; ARB; ACE2 receptor,文献类型:Review,CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS,31,Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Infection Taking ACEI/ARB,"作者:Rico-Mesa, JS (Rico-Mesa, Juan Simon)[ 1 ] ; White, A (White, Averi)[ 1 ] ; Anderson, AS (Anderson, Allen S.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,出版年: APR 14 2020,"Univ Texas Hlth San Antonio, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Dis, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr,MC 7872, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA.

"摘要
Background: During the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), internet hospitals in China were engaged with epidemic prevention and control, offering epidemic-related online services and medical support to the public.

Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China.

Methods: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees' group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees' tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed.

Results: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic.

Conclusions: Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public's ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.",作者关键词:internet hospital; telemedicine; novel coronavirus disease; pandemic; prevention; control; coronavirus; COVID-19; public health; infectious disease,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,e18908,Internet Hospitals Help Prevent and Control the Epidemic of COVID-19 in China: Multicenter User Profiling Study,"作者:Gong, K (Gong, Kai)[ 1 ] ; Xu, Z (Xu, Zhong)[ 1 ] ; Cai, ZF (Cai, Zhefeng)[ 2 ] ; Chen, YX (Chen, Yuxiu)[ 2 ] ; Wang, ZX (Wang, Zhanxiang)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,special project for COVID-19 prevention and control of Xiamen city ,出版年: APR 14 2020,"Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Internet Hosp, 10 Shanggu Rd, Xiamen 361003, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Since December 2019, the infection of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and caused great public concern. Both COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belong to the coronavirus family and both invade target cells through ACE2. An in-depth understanding of ACE2 and a series of physiological and physiological changes caused by the virus invading the human body may help to discover and explain the corresponding clinical phenomena and then deal with them timely. In addition, ACE2 is a potential therapeutic target. This article will summarize the role of ACE2 in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation in order to provide the basis for subsequent related research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development.",作者关键词:New coronavirus (COVID-19); Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV),文献类型:Review; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1007/s10096-020-03883-y,Searching therapeutic strategy of new coronavirus pneumonia from angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: the target of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV,"作者:Li, SR (Li, Shu-ren)[ 1 ] ; Tang, ZJ (Tang, Zi-jian)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, ZH (Li, Zai-han)[ 3 ] ; Liu, X (Liu, Xuan)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,,APR 2020,"Hebei Gen Hosp, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers and increase the current knowledge on the perinatal consequences of COVID-19. Nineteen neonates were admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 31 to February 29, 2020. Their mothers were clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19. We prospectively collected and analyzed data of mothers and infants. There are 19 neonates included in the research. Among them, 10 mothers were confirmed COVID-19 by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, and 9 mothers were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. Delivery occurred in an isolation room and neonates were immediately separated from the mothers and isolated for at least 14 days. No fetal distress was found. Gestational age of the neonates was 38.6 +/- 1.5 weeks, and average birth weight was 3293 +/- 425 g. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, urine, and feces of all neonates were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in breast milk and amniotic fluid was negative too. None of the neonates developed clinical, radiologic, hematologic, or biochemical evidence of COVID-19. No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and no perinatal complications in the third trimester were found in our study. The delivery should occur in isolation and neonates should be separated from the infected mothers and care givers.",作者关键词:coronavirus disease 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus; maternal-infant infection; newborn,文献类型:Article; Early Access,FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11684-020-0772-y,Clinical characteristics of 19 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19,"作者:Liu, W (Liu Wei)[ 1 ] ; Wang, J (Wang Jing)[ 1 ] ; Li, WB (Li Wenbin)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, ZX (Zhou Zhaoxian)[ 1 ] ; Liu, SY (Liu Siying)[ 1 ] ; Rong, ZH (Rong Zhihui)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Dept Pediat, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

Introduction Among surgeons worldwide, a concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques has been raised due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) with the creation of pneumoperitoneum. Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Methods A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. Results Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic. There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. Conclusions Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Laparoscopic viral transmission; Smoke evacuation; Robotic surgery; SARS-CoV-2; Viral transmission,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY,10.1007/s11605-020-04592-9,What Is the Appropriate Use of Laparoscopy over Open Procedures in the Current COVID-19 Climate?,"作者:Vigneswaran, Y (Vigneswaran, Yalini)[ 1 ] ; Prachand, VN (Prachand, Vivek N.)[ 1 ] ; Posner, MC (Posner, Mitchell C.)[ 1 ] ; Matthews, JB (Matthews, Jeffrey B.)[ 1 ] ; Hussain, M (Hussain, Mustafa)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Univ Chicago, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, 5841 S Maryland,Rm G-210, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.

"摘要
The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has led to more than seven thousand deaths. Unfortunately, there are no specific drugs available to cure this disease. Type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs) may play an important role in host defense mechanisms. Based on the idea of host-directed therapy (HDT), we performed a negative co-expression analysis using big data of 60 000 Affymetrix expression arrays and 5000 TCGA data sets to determine the functions of TAS2R10, which can be activated by numerous bitter substances. Excitingly, we found that the main functions of TAS2R10 involved controlling infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, suggesting that TAS2R10 is a key trigger of host defense pathways. To quickly guide the clinical treatment of 2019-nCoV, we searched currently available drugs that are agonists of TAS2Rs. We identified many cheap, available, and safe medicines, such as diphenidol, quinine, chloroquine, artemisinin, chlorpheniramine, yohimbine, and dextromethorphan, which may target the most common symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV. We suggest that a cocktail-like recipe of existing bitter drugs may help doctors to fight this catastrophic disease and that the general public may drink or eat bitter substances, such as coffee, tea, or bitter vegetables, to reduce the risk of infection.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; cytokine storm; infectious disease; type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs),文献类型:Article; Early Access,FASEB JOURNAL,10.1096/fj.202000502,Existing bitter medicines for fighting 2019-nCoV-associated infectious diseases,"作者:Li, XQ (Li, Xiangqi)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, CB (Zhang, Chaobao)[ 2 ] ; Liu, LY (Liu, Lianyong)[ 3 ] ; Gu, MJ (Gu, Mingjun)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,Pudong Health and Family Planning Commission of Shanghai ,APR 2020,"Second Mil Med Univ, Shanghai Gongli Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China.

"摘要

"摘要
A novel RNA betacoronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has now been declared pandemic disease by WHO. Guo et al published the first report of biochemical features in patients with diabetes and the further risk that this disease can determine to the progression of Covid-19. Among different cytokines found significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is already increased in conditions of chronic inflammation, may play a more deleterious role in Covid-19 infection. Targeting the overexpression of Il-6 effects with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor or using Janus Kinase inhibitors may be particularly helpful for treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia in diabetes.",作者关键词:Covid-19; diabetes; inflammation; IL-6,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,DIABETES-METABOLISM RESEARCH AND REVIEWS,e33213321,Covid-19 and diabetes mellitus: unveiling the interaction of two pandemics,"作者:Maddaloni, E (Maddaloni, Ernesto)[ 1 ] ; Buzzetti, R (Buzzetti, Raffaella)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Endocrinology & Metabolism,,10.1002/dmrr.3321,"Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Expt Med, Viale Regina Elena 324, I-00161 Rome, Italy.

"摘要
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-Cov-2]) nucleic acid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false-negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay that can detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories.",作者关键词:COVID-19; fingerstick blood; lateral flow immunoassay; point-of-care testing; rapid IgM-IgG combined test; SARS-CoV-2 virus infection,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25727,Development and clinical application of a rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis,"作者:Li, ZT (Li, Zhengtu)[ 1 ] ; Yi, YX (Yi, Yongxiang)[ 2 ] ; Luo, XM (Luo, Xiaomei)[ 3 ] ; Xiong, N (Xiong, Nian)[ 4 ] ; Liu, Y (Liu, Yang)[ 5 ] ; Li, SQ (Li, Shaoqiang)[ 1 ] ; Sun, RL (Sun, Ruilin)[ 6 ] ; Wang, YQ (Wang, Yanqun)[ 1 ] ; Hu, BC (Hu, Bicheng)[ 7 ] ; Chen, W (Chen, Wei)[ 8 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,,APR 2020,"Guangzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou Inst Resp Hlth, Natl Clin Res Ctr Resp Dis,State Key Lab Resp Dis, Guangzhou 510120, Peoples R China.

This study aimed (1) to present public health interventions to mitigate the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 implemented in Poland between January 9 and March 29, 2020, and (2) to analyze the potential impact of these regulations on the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland.

All legal regulations published in the Journal of Laws between January 9 and March 29, 2020, were analyzed. Out of 406 legal regulations identified, 56 were related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the official announcements published on the governmental websites dedicated to the coronavirus and health issues were analyzed.

On March 4, Poland reported the first laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case. On March 9, Poland introduced border sanitary control. Six days after the first laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, all mass events in Poland were banned. All schools and universities were closed 8 days after the first COVID-19 case. All gastronomic facilities and sport and entertainment services were limited starting on March 14. Eleven days after the first COVID-19 case, controls at all Polish borders were introduced, and a ban on entry into Poland by foreigners (with some exemptions) was implemented. Starting on March 15, all citizens returning from abroad had to undergo compulsory 14 days self-quarantine. On March 20, a state of epidemic was announced, which resulted in new social distancing measures starting on March 25.

In Poland, compared to other European countries, far-reaching solutions were implemented relatively early to reduce the spread of infection.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; COVID-19; Epidemics; Health Policy,文献类型:Article,MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,e924730,Public Health Interventions to Mitigate Early Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland,"作者:Pinkas, J (Pinkas, Jaroslaw)[ 1 ] ; Jankowski, M (Jankowski, Mateusz)[ 1 ] ; Szumowski, L (Szumowski, Lukasz)[ 2 ] ; Lusawa, A (Lusawa, Aleksandra)[ 3 ] ; Zgliczynski, WS (Zgliczynski, Wojciech S.)[ 1 ] ; Raciborski, F (Raciborski, Filip)[ 4 ] ; Wierzba, W (Wierzba, Waldemar)[ 3 ] ; Gujski, M (Gujski, Mariusz)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,,出版年: APR 13 2020,"Ctr Postgrad Med Educ, Sch Publ Hlth, Warsaw, Poland.

In December 2019, the world started to face a new pandemic situation, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease (COVID-19) clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported. Cardiac manifestations etiology seems to be multifactorial, comprising direct viral myocardial damage, hypoxia, hypotension, enhanced inflammatory status, ACE2-receptors downregulation, drug toxicity, endogenous catecholamine adrenergic status, among others. Studies evaluating patients with COVID-19 presenting cardiac injury markers show that it is associated with poorer outcomes, and arrhythmic events are not uncommon. Besides, drugs currently used to treat the COVID-19 are known to prolong the QT interval and can have a proarrhythmic propensity. This review focus on COVID-19 cardiac and arrhythmic manifestations and, in parallel, makes an appraisal of other virus epidemics as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and H1N1 influenza.",作者关键词:arrhythmia; COVID-19; myocardial damage; myocarditis; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,10.1111/jce.14479,Cardiac and arrhythmic complications in patients with COVID-19,"作者:Kochi, AN (Kochi, Adriano Nunes)[ 1 ] ; Tagliari, AP (Tagliari, Ana Paula)[ 2 ] ; Forleo, GB (Forleo, Giovanni Battista)[ 3 ] ; Fassini, GM (Fassini, Gaetano Michele)[ 1 ] ; Tondo, C (Tondo, Claudio)[ 1,4 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,APR 2020,"Ctr Cardiol Monzino IRCCS, Heart Rhythm Ctr, Via Carlo Parea 4, I-20138 Milan, Italy.

"摘要
""COVID-19"" is the word that certainly isn't forgotten by everybody who lives in the first half of the twenty-first century. COVID-19, as a pandemic, has led many researchers from different biomedical fields to find solutions or treatments to manage the pandemic. However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date. Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy. In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient's immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment. However, currently, there are no approved MSC-based approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 patients but clinical trials ongoing.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mesenchymal stem cell; Stem cell therapy; Immunomodulatory; Clinical trials,文献类型:Review; Early Access,STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS,10.1007/s12015-020-09973-w,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for COVID-19: Present or Future,"作者:Golchin, A (Golchin, Ali)[ 1 ] ; Seyedjafari, E (Seyedjafari, Ehsan)[ 2 ] ; Ardeshirylajimi, A (Ardeshirylajimi, Abdolreza)[ 3,4 ]",研究方向:Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,APR 2020,"Urmia Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Clin Biochem & Appl Cell Sci, Orumiyeh, Iran.

"摘要
Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease of pandemic proportions. Healthcare workers in Singapore working in high-risk areas were mandated to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 face mask and protective eyewear while attending to patients.

Objectives We sought to determine the risk factors associated with the development of de novo PPE-associated headaches as well as the perceived impact of these headaches on their personal health and work performance. The impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing headache disorders was also investigated.

Methods This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers at our tertiary institution who were working in high-risk hospital areas during COVID-19. All respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire.

Results A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years. Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)], and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)]. Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents. Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 5.2 (SD 2.4) hours, P < .0001] or medical ICU [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 2.2 (SD 0.41) hours, P < .0001]. Out of 158 respondents, 128 (81.0%) respondents developed de novo PPE-associated headaches. A pre-existing primary headache diagnosis (OR = 4.20, 95% CI 1.48-15.40; P = .030) and combined PPE usage for >4 hours per day (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.35-11.31; P = .012) were independently associated with de novo PPE-associated headaches. Since COVID-19 outbreak, 42/46 (91.3%) of respondents with pre-existing headache diagnosis either ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that the increased PPE usage had affected the control of their background headaches, which affected their level of work performance.

Conclusion Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.",作者关键词:personal protection equipment (PPE); headache; healthcare workers; face mask; N95; eyewear; goggles; coronavirus disease; coronavirus disease 2019,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEADACHE,10.1111/head.13811,Headaches Associated With Personal Protective Equipment - A Cross-Sectional Study Among Frontline Healthcare Workers During COVID-19,"作者:Ong, JJY (Ong, Jonathan J.

"摘要
The COVID-19 pandemic exposes underlying inequalities in our socio-economic and health systems, such as gender-based violence (GBV). In emergencies, particularly ones that involve quarantine, GBV often increases. Policymakers must utilize community expertise, technology and existing global guidelines to disrupt these trends in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic. Gender norms and roles relegating women to the realm of care work puts them on the frontlines in an epidemic, while often excluding them from developing the response. It is critical to value women's roles in society and include their voices in the decision-making process to avoid unintended consequences and ensure a comprehensive response that caters to the needs of the most vulnerable groups.",作者关键词:COVID-19; crisis; gender; gender-based violence; services,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS,10.1111/dewb.12261,Lessons Never Learned: Crisis and gender-based violence,"作者:John, N (John, Neetu)[ 1 ] ; Casey, SE (Casey, Sara E.)[ 2 ] ; Carino, G (Carino, Giselle)[ 3 ] ; McGovern, T (McGovern, Terry)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics,,APR 2020,"Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA.

"摘要
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly evolved and changed our way of life in an unprecedented manner. The emergence of COVID-19 has impacted transplantation worldwide. The impact has not been just restricted to issues pertaining to donors or recipients, but also health-care resource utilization as the intensity of cases in certain jurisdictions exceeds available capacity. Here we provide a personal viewpoint representing different jurisdictions from around the world in order to outline the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on organ transplantation. Based on our collective experience, we discuss mitigation strategies such as donor screening, resource planning, and a staged approach to transplant volume considerations as local resource issues demand. We also discuss issues related to transplant-related research during the pandemic, the role of transplant infectious diseases, and the influence of transplant societies for education and disseminating current information.",作者关键词:clinical decision-making; clinical research; practice; donors and donation; donor-derived infections; infection and infectious agents - viral; infectious disease; organ transplantation in general,文献类型:Article; Early Access,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPLANTATION,10.1111/ajt.15876,COVID-19: A global transplant perspective on successfully navigating a pandemic,"作者:Kumar, D (Kumar, Deepali)[ 1 ] ; Manuel, O (Manuel, Oriol)[ 2,3 ] ; Natori, Y (Natori, Yoichiro)[ 4 ] ; Egawa, H (Egawa, Hiroto)[ 5 ] ; Grossi, P (Grossi, Paolo)[ 6 ] ; Han, SH (Han, Sang-Hoon)[ 7 ] ; Fernandez-Ruiz, M (Fernandez-Ruiz, Mario)[ 8 ] ; Humar, A (Humar, Atul)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Surgery; Transplantation,,APR 2020,"Univ Hlth Network, Multiorgan Transplant Program, Transplant Infect Dis, Toronto, ON, Canada.

"摘要
The human fragment crystallizable (Fc)gamma receptor (R) interacts with antigen-complexed immunoglobulin (Ig)G ligands to both activate and modulate a powerful network of inflammatory host-protective effector functions that are key to the normal physiology of immune resistance to pathogens. More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent Fc gamma R-mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a ""scaffolding"" role for Fc gamma R which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual Fc gamma R function and the complexity of the relationships between Fc gamma Rs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent ""next-gen"" therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating Fc gamma Rs or the inhibitory Fc gamma RIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of Fc gamma R interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of Fc gamma R and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.",作者关键词:ADCC; Fc receptors; immune therapy; monoclonal antibodies; phagocytosis; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,IMMUNOLOGY AND CELL BIOLOGY,10.1111/imcb.12326,Harnessing the immune system via Fc gamma R function in immune therapy: a pathway to next-gen mAbs,"作者:Chenoweth, AM (Chenoweth, Alicia M.)[ 1,2,3,6 ] ; Wines, BD (Wines, Bruce D.)[ 1,2,4 ] ; Anania, JC (Anania, Jessica C.)[ 1,2,5,7 ] ; Hogarth, PM (Hogarth, P.)[ 1,2,4 ]",研究方向:Cell Biology; Immunology,National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,APR 2020,"Burnet Inst, GPO Box 2284, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.

"摘要
Background & Aims Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised world concern for global epidemic since December, 2019. Limited data are available for liver function in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to investigate the risk factors related to liver injury in the COVID-19 patients.

Methods A retrospective study was performed in non-ICU Ward at Jinyintan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to February 23, 2020. Consecutively confirmed COVID-19 discharged cases were enrolled. The clinical characteristics of patients with liver injury and without liver injury were compared.

Results A total of 79 COVID-19 patients were included. 31.6%, 35.4% and 5.1% COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin respectively. Median value of ALT, AST and bilirubin for entire cohort was 36.5 (17.5 similar to 71.5) U/L, 34.5 (25.3 similar to 55.3) U/L and 12.7 (8.1 similar to 15.4) mmol/L respectively. There were no significant differences in age, previous medical history and symptoms between the two groups. Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with COVID-19 (P < .05); compared with patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, CRP and CT score (P < .05) and had a longer length of stay (P < .05). Logistic regression analyses suggested that the extent of pulmonary lesions on CT was a predictor of liver function damage (P < .05).

Conclusions Liver injury is common in non-ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It may be related to systemic inflammation. Intense monitoring and evaluation of liver function in patients with severe pulmonary imaging lesions should be considered.",作者关键词:COVID-19; liver injury; pulmonary lesions; systemic inflammation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,LIVER INTERNATIONAL,10.1111/liv.14449,Clinical characteristics of non-ICU hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and liver injury: A retrospective study,"作者:Xie, HS (Xie, Hansheng)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, JM (Zhao, Jianming)[ 1 ] ; Lian, NF (Lian, Ningfang)[ 1 ] ; Lin, S (Lin, Su)[ 2 ] ; Xie, QF (Xie, Qunfang)[ 1 ] ; Zhuo, HC (Zhuo, Huichang)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Gastroenterology & Hepatology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, 20 Chazhong Rd, Fuzhou 350005, Fujian, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Respiratory failure in COVID-19 is a common feature in fatal cases and has been considered as a failure of the immune system to control the virus. Here we report the case of COVID-19 affecting an immunocompromised women and her presumably immunocompetent spouse. A married couple (age 60 years) was simultaneously admitted to the emergency department on 10 March 2020 because of dyspnoea and fever, consistent with COVID-19. The wife (patient 1) was partially immunocompromised as a consequence of a recently started chemotherapy with fulves-trant and abemaciclid for recurring breast cancer, her husband (patient 2) had been healthy except for a history of controlled arterial hypertension. Both patients were treated with darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine. The clinical course of the immunocompromised partner was benign, without need of intensive care. She was able to leave the hospital on day 6 after admission. In contrast, her husband needed intensive care and his recovery was slow, although eventually successful too. These findings suggest that the course of COVID-19 is not necessarily ominous in the presence of a compromised immune response and tend to reinforce the emerging therapeutic concepts of a controlled mitigation of the immune cascade following SARS CoV-2 infection.",作者关键词:COVID-19; chemotherapy; immunosuppression outcome; case report,文献类型:Article,SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY,w20246,Benign COVID-19 in an immunocompromised cancer patient - the case of a married couple,"作者:Valentina, S (Valentina, Spezzani)[ 1 ] ; Alessio, P (Alessio, Piunno)[ 2 ] ; Hans-Ulrich, I (Hans-Ulrich, Iselin)[ 3 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 11 2020,"Interprofess Commun, Wenkenstr 81, CH-4125 Riehen, Switzerland.

"摘要
A new strain of coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, probably originating from a wild-animal contamination. Since then, the situation rapidly evolved from a cluster of patients with pneumonia, to a regional epidemic and now to a pandemic called COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This evolution is related to the peculiar modes of transmission of the disease and to the globalization and lifestyle of the 21st century that created the perfect scenario for virus spread.

Even though research has not evidenced particular susceptibility of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments were considered potential risk factors. In this context, initiating treatments with these agents should be cautiously weighted and regular ongoing treatments shall be continued, while the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced whenever possible. Due to the increased risk of contamination, elective endoscopic procedures and surgeries should be postponed and IBD online appointments shall be considered. IBD patients shall also follow the recommendations provided to the general population, such as minimization of contact with infected or suspected patients and to wash hands frequently.

In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, this pandemic can only be controlled through prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with the main objectives of providing patients the best healthcare possible and reduce mortality.",作者关键词:Gastroenterology; inflammatory bowel disease; endoscopy; epidemiology; immunology,文献类型:Review; Early Access,UNITED EUROPEAN GASTROENTEROLOGY JOURNAL,UNSP 2050640620920157,The daily impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology,"作者:Magro, F (Magro, Fernando)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Abreu, C (Abreu, Candida)[ 4,5 ] ; Rahier, JF (Rahier, Jean-Francois)[ 6 ]",研究方向:Gastroenterology & Hepatology,,10.1177/2050640620920157,"Univ Porto, Fac Med, Unit Pharmacol & Therapeut, Dept Biomed, Rua Placido Costa, P-4200 Porto, Portugal.

"摘要
The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.",,文献类型:Article,LANCET,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9,COVID-19 and Italy: what next?,"作者:Remuzzi, A (Remuzzi, Andrea)[ 1 ] ; Remuzzi, G (Remuzzi, Giuseppe)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 11 2020,"Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, I-24044 Dalmine, Italy.

"摘要
We describe the first case of acute cardiac injury directly linked to myocardial localization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a 69-year-old patient with flu-like symptoms rapidly degenerating into respiratory distress, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. The patient was successfully treated with venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mechanical ventilation. Cardiac function fully recovered in 5 days and ECMO was removed. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated low-grade myocardial inflammation and viral particles in the myocardium suggesting either a viraemic phase or, alternatively, infected macrophage migration from the lung.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; Coronavirus; Myocardial inflammation; Cardiac injury; Cardiogenic shock; Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE,10.1002/ejhf.1828,Myocardial localization of coronavirus in COVID-19 cardiogenic shock,"作者:Tavazzi, G (Tavazzi, Guido)[ 1,2 ] ; Pellegrini, C (Pellegrini, Carlo)[ 1,3 ] ; Maurelli, M (Maurelli, Marco)[ 4 ] ; Belliato, M (Belliato, Mirko)[ 2 ] ; Sciutti, F (Sciutti, Fabio)[ 2 ] ; Bottazzi, A (Bottazzi, Andrea)[ 2 ] ; Sepe, PA (Sepe, Paola Alessandra)[ 5 ] ; Resasco, T (Resasco, Tullia)[ 5 ] ; Camporotondo, R (Camporotondo, Rita)[ 6,7 ] ; Bruno, R (Bruno, Raffaele)[ 1,8 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,Ministry of Health - Turkey,APR 2020,"IRCCS Policlin San Matteo Fdn, ICU1 Dept Intens Med, Piazzale Golgi 19, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.

The whole world is going through an unprecedented period during the pandemic of COVID-19. This pandemic has affected all aspects of daily life with far-reaching implications, especially in most aspects of healthcare. Practice of surgery across the globe is in a standstill as of now. When we restart surgical practices across world, we have to bring new protocols and practices in place to combat the transmission.

"摘要
In this article, we report results of a molecular docking analysis of commonly occurring natural product compounds against COVID-19 6LU7 and 6Y2E proteases. Our results show that several of these compounds have binding affinity against both the COVID-19 proteases, and compare well with a known anti-HIV drug, Saquinavir. Many of the compounds form an integral component of many cuisines, both Indian as well as others. We propose that some of these compounds could be easily and quickly positioned to hold fort against the COVID-19 virus, until of course newer therapies are discovered and detailed studies are taken to empirically validate some of the compounds for their ability to inhibit the virus.",作者关键词:Affinity/binding energy; COVID-19 protease; drug discovery; ligands; natural products,文献类型:Article,CURRENT SCIENCE,10.18520/cs/v118/i7/1087-1092,Molecular docking analysis of selected natural products from plants for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"作者:Sampangi-Ramaiah, MH (Sampangi-Ramaiah, Megha Hastantram)[ 1 ] ; Vishwakarma, R (Vishwakarma, Ram)[ 2 ] ; Shaanker, RU (Shaanker, R.

"摘要
The last century has witnessed several assaults from RNA viruses, resulting in millions of death throughout the world. The 21st century appears no longer an exception, with the trend continued with escalated fear of SARS coronavirus in 2002 and further concern of influenza H5N1 in 2003. A novel influenza virus created the first pandemic of the 21st century, the pandemic flu in 2009 preceded with the emergence of another deadly virus, MERS-CoV in 2012. A novel coronavirus ""SARS-CoV-2"" (and the disease COVID-19) emerged suddenly, causing a rapid outbreak with a moderate case fatality rate. This virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population, indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure. The big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out? Endemic viruses during circulation may acquire mutations to infect naive, as well as individual with pre-existing immunity. Continuous monitoring is strongly advisable, not only to the newly infected individuals, but also to those recovered individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as re-infection may lead to the selection of escape mutants and subsequent dissemination to the population.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; SARS; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; pre existing immunity,文献类型:Review; Early Access,CRITICAL REVIEWS IN MICROBIOLOGY,10.1080/1040841X.2020.1739001,Emergence of Novel Coronavirus and COVID-19: whether to stay or die out?,"作者:Biswas, A (Biswas, Asim)[ 1 ] ; Bhattacharjee, U (Bhattacharjee, Uttaran)[ 1 ] ; Chakrabarti, AK (Chakrabarti, Alok Kumar)[ 1 ] ; Tewari, DN (Tewari, Devendra Nath)[ 1 ] ; Banu, H (Banu, Hasina)[ 2 ] ; Dutta, S (Dutta, Shanta)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Microbiology,,APR 2020,"ICMR Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Div Virol, Kolkata 700010, India.

"摘要
The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between dynamic changes in the nasopharyngeal viral load of patients infected with the new coronavirus causing pneumonia and lymphocyte count disease severity. Cases newly diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2020 to February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from throat swab sample Delta CT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts, coagulation system factor levels, myocardial injury indexes, and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4(+) T lymphocyte, and CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively). Moreover, there were significant differences in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group (p = 0.029, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively), and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count, CD4(+) T lymphocyte count, and CD8(+) T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated (p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, and hypersensitive troponin T (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p < 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.",作者关键词:nasopharyngeal virus RNA load; COVID-19; lymphocyte count; organ damage,文献类型:Article; Early Access,VIRAL IMMUNOLOGY,10.1089/vim.2020.0062,Correlation Between Relative Nasopharyngeal Virus RNA Load and Lymphocyte Count Disease Severity in Patients with COVID-19,"作者:Liu, Y (Liu, Yang)[ 1 ] ; Liao, WJ (Liao, Wenjian)[ 2 ] ; Wan, LG (Wan, Lagen)[ 1 ] ; Xiang, TX (Xiang, Tianxing)[ 3 ] ; Zhang, W (Zhang, Wei)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Immunology; Virology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Nanchang Univ, Dept Resp Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of global concern. Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Epidemiology; Hydroxychloroquine; Hypothesis; Immunity; Pathogenesis; Vaccines; Vitamin D,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10067-020-05073-9,Rheumatologists' perspective on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and potential therapeutic targets,"作者:Misra, DP (Misra, Durga Prasanna)[ 1 ] ; Agarwal, V (Agarwal, Vikas)[ 1 ] ; Gasparyan, AY (Gasparyan, Armen Yuri)[ 2 ] ; Zimba, O (Zimba, Olena)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Rheumatology,,APR 2020,"Sanjay Gandhi Postgrad Inst Med Sci, Dept Clin Immunol & Rheumatol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.

The presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in COVID-19 patients suggests the existence of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac disease. The Notch signalling is a major regulator of cardiovascular function and it is also implicated in several biological processes mediating viral infections. In this report we discuss the possibility to target Notch signalling to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and interfere with the progression of COVID-19- associated heart and lungs disease.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease; COVID-19; Cardiovascular disease; Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Furin; ADAM17; Notch,文献类型:Editorial Material,BASIC RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY,31,"COVID-19 in the heart and the lungs: could we ""Notch"" the inflammatory storm?","作者:Rizzo, P (Rizzo, Paola)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Dalla Sega, FV (Dalla Sega, Francesco Vieceli)[ 3 ] ; Fortini, F (Fortini, Francesca)[ 3 ] ; Marracino, L (Marracino, Luisa)[ 1,2 ] ; Rapezzi, C (Rapezzi, Claudio)[ 3,4 ] ; Ferrari, R (Ferrari, Roberto)[ 3,4 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,出版年: APR 9 2020,"Univ Ferrara, Dept Morphol Surg & Expt Med, Ferrara, Italy.

"摘要
Since December 2019, the world is potentially facing one of the most difficult infectious situations of the last decades. COVID-19 epidemic warrants consideration as a mass casualty incident (MCI) of the highest nature. An optimal MCI/disaster management should consider all four phases of the so-called disaster cycle: mitigation, planning, response, and recovery. COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated the worldwide unpreparedness to face a global MCI. This present paper thus represents a call for action to solicitate governments and the Global Community to actively start effective plans to promote and improve MCI management preparedness in general, and with an obvious current focus on COVID-19.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemia; Pademia; Mass casualties; Management; Resource; Criticalities; WSES,文献类型:Article,WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY,26,COVID-19 the showdown for mass casualty preparedness and management: the Cassandra Syndrome,"作者:Coccolini, F (Coccolini, Federico)[ 1 ] ; Sartelli, M (Sartelli, Massimo)[ 2 ] ; Kluger, Y (Kluger, Yoram)[ 3 ] ; Pikoulis, E (Pikoulis, Emmanouil)[ 4 ] ; Karamagioli, E (Karamagioli, Evika)[ 5 ] ; Moore, EE (Moore, Ernest E.)[ 6 ] ; Biffl, WL (Biffl, Walter L.)[ 7 ] ; Peitzman, A (Peitzman, Andrew)[ 8 ] ; Hecker, A (Hecker, Andreas)[ 9 ] ; Chirica, M (Chirica, Mircea)[ 10 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Emergency Medicine; Surgery,,出版年: APR 9 2020,"Pisa Univ Hosp, Emergency & Trauma Surg Dept, Via Paradisia 1, I-56100 Pisa, Italy.

"摘要
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. Due to growing demand for reagents and/or kits to extract SARS-CoV-2 RNA for subsequent RT-qPCR diagnostics, there is a worldwide risk of shortages. With a detection sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI: 86.2-99.9%), we describe a simple, fast, alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, where samples are simply heat-processed for 5 min at 98 degrees C before a commonly-used RT-qPCR procedure.",,文献类型:Article,EUROSURVEILLANCE,10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.14.2000398,"An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2-escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage, Copenhagen, Denmark, March 2020","作者:Fomsgaard, AS (Fomsgaard, Anna S.)[ 1 ] ; Rosenstierne, MW (Rosenstierne, Maiken Worsoe)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,出版年: APR 9 2020,"Statens Serum Inst, Dept Virus & Microbiol Special Diagnost, Copenhagen, Denmark.

We computed the number of excess cases by region from 24 February to 8 March 2020 and found a correlation with the number of reported COVID-19 cases so far.

"摘要
A mathematical model is proposed to assess the effects of a vaccine on the time evolution of a coronavirus outbreak. The model has the basic structure of SIRI compartments (susceptible-infectious-recovered-infectious) and is implemented by taking into account of the behavioral changes of individuals in response to the available information on the status of the disease in the community. We found that the cumulative incidence may be significantly reduced when the information coverage is high enough and/or the information delay is short, especially when the reinfection rate is high enough to sustain the presence of the disease in the community. This analysis is inspired by the ongoing outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19.",作者关键词:Epidemic model; Coronavirus; Reinfection; Vaccine; Information,文献类型:Article; Early Access,RICERCHE DI MATEMATICA,10.1007/s11587-020-00506-8,Effects of information-dependent vaccination behavior on coronavirus outbreak: insights from a SIRI model,"作者:Buonomo, B (Buonomo, Bruno)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Mathematics,Italian National Group for the Mathematical Physics (GNFM) of National Institute for Advanced Mathematics (INdAM) ,APR 2020,"Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Math & Applicat, Via Cintia, I-80126 Naples, Italy.

"摘要
Introduction: At the end of 2019, Wuhan, a city in China with a population of about 11 million, witnessed the outbreak of unusual pneumonia. As of 29 March 2020, the disease has spread to more 199 countries and territories worldwide. The 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is known as the probable causative agent of the illness. Areas covered: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19. Expert opinion: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19. Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19. Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19. Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19. Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation. The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation.",作者关键词:Novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV2; immune-epidemiology; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY,10.1080/1744666X.2020.1750954,Immune-epidemiological parameters of the novel coronavirus - a perspective,"作者:Saghazadeh, A (Saghazadeh, Amene)[ 1,2 ] ; Rezaei, N (Rezaei, Nima)[ 3,4,5 ]",研究方向:Immunology,,APR 2020,"Childrens Med Ctr Hosp, Dr Qarib St,Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran 14194, Iran.

"摘要
Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor its spread and immune responses to it. However, little information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority.",,文献类型:Article,CELL HOST & MICROBE,10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.002,A Sequence Homology and Bioinformatic Approach Can Predict Candidate Targets for Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2,"作者:Grifoni, A (Grifoni, Alba)[ 1 ] ; Sidney, J (Sidney, John)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yun)[ 2 ] ; Scheuermann, RH (Scheuermann, Richard H.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Peters, B (Peters, Bjoern)[ 1,4 ] ; Sette, A (Sette, Alessandro)[ 1,4 ]",研究方向:Microbiology; Parasitology; Virology,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

"摘要
In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China. Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Infectious disease; MERS; Pneumonia; Public health; SARS; SARS-COV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY,10.1007/s40121-020-00295-5,Coronavirus: Update Related to the Current Outbreak of COVID-19,"作者:Gabutti, G (Gabutti, Giovanni)[ 1 ] ; D'Anchera, E (D'Anchera, Erica)[ 2 ] ; Sandri, F (Sandri, Federica)[ 2 ] ; Savio, M (Savio, Marta)[ 2 ] ; Stefanati, A (Stefanati, Armando)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,APR 2020,"Univ Ferrara, Dept Med Sci, Ferrara, Italy.

COVID-19 is placing considerable strain on healthcare systems. Disaster and military medicine specialists were involved in the outbreak in Italy, after many units were overwhelmed. Health providers were caught off guard and personnel was unprepared to face this unprecedented threat. Local decisions accelerated the rate of the spread. Many countries declared a state of emergency and lockdown to contain the exponential transmission of the disease. The purpose of this review is to suggest quick key points of strategies to implement in obstetric units without delay to respond to the oncoming wave, based on experience and feedback from the field.

"摘要
The current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus is a worldwide public health concern. To aboard this emergency, and like never before, scientific groups around the world have been working in a fast and coordinated way to get the maximum of information about this virus when it has been almost 3 months since the first cases were detected in Wuhan province in China. The complete genome sequences of around 450 isolates are available, and studies about similarities and differences among them and with the close related viruses that caused similar epidemics in this century. In this work, we studied the complete genome of the first four cases of the new coronavirus disease in Chile, from patients who traveled to Europe and Southeast Asia. Our findings reveal at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory, coming from Europe and Asia. We also sub-classified the isolates into variants according to punctual mutations in the genome. Our work contributes to global information about transmission dynamics and the importance to take control measures to stop the spread of the infection.",作者关键词:COVID-19; phylogeny; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25797,Phylogenetic analysis of the first four SARS-CoV-2 cases in Chile,"作者:Castillo, AE (Castillo, Andres E.)[ 1 ] ; Parra, B (Parra, Barbara)[ 1 ] ; Tapia, P (Tapia, Paz)[ 1 ] ; Acevedo, A (Acevedo, Alejandra)[ 2 ] ; Lagos, J (Lagos, Jaime)[ 1 ] ; Andrade, W (Andrade, Winston)[ 2 ] ; Arata, L (Arata, Loredana)[ 1 ] ; Leal, G (Leal, Gabriel)[ 2 ] ; Barra, G (Barra, Gisselle)[ 1 ] ; Tambley, C (Tambley, Carolina)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,Institute of Public Health of Chile ,APR 2020,"Inst Publ Hlth Chile, Mol Genet Sub Dept, Av Marathon 1000, Santiago 7780050, Chile.

"摘要
Background A new type of coronavirus, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), is causing an increasing number of cases of pneumonia and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020. The virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, and traditional Chinese herbal medicine is being used for its treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess studies of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We will search electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang database using keywords related to COVID-19 and traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Reference lists of relevant trials and reviews will be searched. We will manually search gray literature, such as conference proceedings and academic degree dissertations, and trial registries. Two independent reviewers will screen studies (XL and DZ), extract data (YL and LG), and evaluate risk of bias (YL and DZ). Data analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3.5) and R software (version 3.6.1). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard chi-square test with a significance level of P < 0.10. Biases associated with study size (e.g., publication bias) will be investigated using funnel plots, Egger's test and Begg's test, and Trim and Fill analysis. Discussion This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19. The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treatment or prevention of these novel viral infections affecting the pneumonia will be investigated.

"摘要
Objective: To observe and analyze the application effect of the combined mode of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) micro-video during the COVID-19 epidemic period in the distance teaching practice of interns in the emergency department.

Materials and Methods: The subjects of this study were 60 trainee nurses who conducted emergency nursing practice in Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 1 to February 29, 2020. At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, they were divided into two groups: (1) the experimental group (combined mode of MOOC micro-video) and (2) the control group (traditional theory teaching combined with clinical practice teaching). The differences of theoretical and practical examination scores and teaching satisfaction between the two groups were compared.

Results: There was no significant difference in theoretical, practical, and total examination scores between the two groups, but in terms of teaching satisfaction, the overall satisfaction, the degree of easy understanding, the evaluation of teachers and learning results in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group, with statistical difference (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Compared with the traditional teaching methods, the effect of combined mode of MOOC micro-video in emergency nursing practice is the same as that of traditional teaching methods, but the satisfaction is higher, so it is more suitable to be used in nursing practice during the COVID-19 epidemic period, so as to effectively reduce the cross-infection between doctors, nurses, and teaching staff.",作者关键词:COVID-19; MOOC micro-video; intern; distance teaching; telemedicine,文献类型:Article; Early Access,TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,10.1089/tmj.2020.0079,The Distance Teaching Practice of Combined Mode of Massive Open Online Course Micro-Video for Interns in Emergency Department During the COVID-19 Epidemic Period,"作者:Zhou, T (Zhou, Ting)[ 1 ] ; Huang, SF (Huang, Sufang)[ 1 ] ; Cheng, J (Cheng, Jing)[ 1 ] ; Xiao, YR (Xiao, Yaru)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Tongji Hosp, 1095 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

OBJECTIVE

To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia.

DESIGN

Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal.

DATA SOURCES

PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020.

STUDY SELECTION

Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.

DATA EXTRACTION

At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).

RESULTS

2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed.

CONCLUSION

Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.",,文献类型:Review,BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL,m1328,Prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 infection: systematic review and critical appraisal,"作者:Wynants, L (Wynants, Laure)[ 1,2 ] ; Van Calster, B (Van Calster, Ben)[ 2,3 ] ; Bonten, MMJ (Bonten, Marc M.

"摘要
The recent Italian outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 led to an unprecedented burden on our health care system. Despite head and neck-otolaryngology not being a front-line specialty in dealing with this disease, our department had to face several specific issues. Despite a massive reallocation of resources in the hospital, we managed to keep the service active, improving safety measures for our personnel, specifically during common otolaryngologic maneuvers known to produce aerosols. Furthermore, we strived to maintain our teaching role, giving residents an inclusive role in managing the response to the emergency state, and we progressively integrated our inactive specialists into other service rotations to relieve front-line colleagues' burden. Specific issues and management decisions are discussed in detail in the article.",作者关键词:new coronavirus disease 19; otolaryngology; head and neck; health care workers' safety,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY,0194599820917914,Role and Management of a Head and Neck Department during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy,"作者:Saibene, AM (Saibene, Alberto Maria)[ 1 ] ; Allevi, F (Allevi, Fabiana)[ 2 ] ; Biglioli, F (Biglioli, Federico)[ 2,3 ] ; Felisati, G (Felisati, Giovanni)[ 1,3 ]",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology; Surgery,,10.1177/0194599820917914,"ASST Santi Paolo & Carlo, Head & Neck Dept, Otolaryngol Unit, Via Antonio di Rudini 8, I-20142 Milan, Italy.

The current COVID-19 pandemic underlines the importance of a mindful utilization of financial and human resources. Preserving resources and manpower is paramount in healthcare. It is important to ensure the ability of surgeons and specialized professionals to function through the pandemic. A conscious effort should be made to minimize infection in this sector. A high mortality rate within this group would be detrimental. This manuscript is the result of a collaboration between the major Italian surgical and anesthesiologic societies: ACOI, SIC, SICUT, SICO, SICG, SIFIPAC, SICE, and SIAARTI. We aim to describe recommended clinical pathways for COVID-19-positive patients requiring acute non-deferrable surgical care.

"摘要
Background Since December 8, 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, but information about children with COVID-19 is limited.

Methods This retrospective and the single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China. We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha. Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020.

Results By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha. Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days. The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms. Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan. As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged. The median time from exposure to a negative RT-PCR was 14 days.

Conclusions The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients. Children who have a familial clustering or have a family member with a definite diagnosis should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.",作者关键词:children; clinical characteristics; coronavirus disease 2019,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY,10.1002/ppul.24762,"Novel coronavirus infection in children outside of Wuhan, China","作者:Shen, QX (Shen, Qinxue)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Guo, W (Guo, Wei)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Guo, T (Guo, Ting)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Li, JH (Li, Jinhua)[ 1,2,3 ] ; He, WL (He, Wenlong)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ni, SS (Ni, Shanshan)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ouyang, XL (Ouyang, Xiaoli)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Liu, JY (Liu, Jiyang)[ 4 ] ; Xie, YL (Xie, Yuanlin)[ 5 ] ; Tan, X (Tan, Xin)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Pediatrics; Respiratory System,National key clinical specialist construction Programs of China ,APR 2020,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, 139 Renmin Middle Rd, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 813 confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019. Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy - COVID-19.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Outbreak; Pandemic; Fighting; Preparedness; International health regulation; Quarantine,文献类型:Editorial Material,INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY,34,Fighting against the common enemy of COVID-19: a practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind,"作者:Qian, X (Qian, Xu)[ 1 ] ; Ren, R (Ren, Ran)[ 2 ] ; Wang, YF (Wang, Youfa)[ 3 ] ; Guo, Y (Guo, Yan)[ 4 ] ; Fang, J (Fang, Jing)[ 5 ] ; Wu, ZD (Wu, Zhong-Dao)[ 6 ] ; Liu, PL (Liu, Pei-Long)[ 4 ] ; Han, TR (Han, Tie-Ru)[ 7 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,,出版年: APR 7 2020,"Fudan Univ, Global Hlth Inst, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has now swept through the continents and poses a global threat to public health. Several investigations have been conducted to identify whether COVID-19 can be transmitted through the ocular route, and the conclusion is that it is a potential route but remains uncertain. Due to the face-to-face communication with patients, frequent exposure to tears and ocular discharge, and the unavoidable use of equipment which requires close proximity, ophthalmologists carry a high risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on 33 articles published by Chinese scholars, guidelines and clinical practice experience in domestic hospitals, we have summarized the Chinese experience through the lens of ophthalmology, hoping to make a contribution to protecting ophthalmologists and patients around the world.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Ophthalmology; Ocular transmission,文献类型:Review,EYE AND VISION,19,A comprehensive Chinese experience against SARS-CoV-2 in ophthalmology,"作者:Yu, AY (Yu, A-Yong)[ 1 ] ; Tu, RX (Tu, Ruixue)[ 1 ] ; Shao, X (Shao, Xu)[ 1 ] ; Pan, AN (Pan, Anpeng)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, KJ (Zhou, Kaijing)[ 1 ] ; Huang, JH (Huang, Jinhai)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Ophthalmology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: APR 7 2020,"Wenzhou Med Univ, Eye Hosp, 270 Xueyuan West Rd, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging modern radiation oncology. At University Hospitals, we have a mandate to offer high-end treatments to all cancer patients. However, in times of crisis we must learn to prioritize resources, especially personnel. Compromising oncological outcome will blur all statistics, therefore all measures must be taken with great caution. Communication with our neighboring countries, within societies and between departments can help meet the challenge.

Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an urgent public health crisis, with epidemiologic models predicting severe consequences, including high death rates, if the virus is permitted to run its course without any intervention or response. Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location.

Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data.

Methods: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption.

Results: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create ""checkpoints"" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak.

Conclusions: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.",作者关键词:COVID-19; smartphone; privacy; contact tracing; peer-to-peer; epidemic; personal data; mobile phone; coronavirus; pandemic,文献类型:Article,JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,e18936,Peer-to-Peer Contact Tracing: Development of a Privacy-Preserving Smartphone App,"作者:Yasaka, TM (Yasaka, Tyler M.)[ 1 ] ; Lehrich, BM (Lehrich, Brandon M.)[ 2 ] ; Sahyouni, R (Sahyouni, Ronald)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,,出版年: APR 7 2020,"Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 1001 Hlth Sci Rd, Irvine, CA 92617 USA.

Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started spreading in Japan. Therefore, the number of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is expected to increase. A working group has been formed to provide telephone consultation services for cases with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 in Japan. During the first 13 days of the service, there were 12 consultations. For each consultation, we advised the patient on the initiation of ECMO and arranged transportation for patients with ECMO. Based on experience from the H1N1 influenza pandemic, transporting patients to experienced facilities is essential to obtain better outcomes.",作者关键词:COVID-19; ECMO; Acute respiratory failure,文献类型:Letter,JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE,24,Japan ECMOnet for COVID-19: telephone consultations for cases with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID-19,团体作者: Japan ECMOnet COVID-19,研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 7 2020,"Shimane Univ, Dept Emergency & Crit Care Med, Ennya Cho 89-1, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.

From a large medical center in Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we report clinical features and prognosis for three women diagnosed with COVID-19 after gynecologic oncology surgery and hospitalized in January 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 was 0.77% (3 of 389) of total hospitalizations and 1.59% (3 of 189) of patients undergoing surgeries in the ward. The infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may be related to the older age, comorbidities, malignant tumor, and surgery in gynecologic hospitalizations. By February 20, 2020, only two of the three patients had met the clinical discharge criteria. Given the long and uncertain incubation period of COVID-19, screening for the virus infection should be carried out for all patients, both preoperatively and postoperatively. Postponement of scheduled gynecologic surgery for patients in the epidemic area should be considered.",,文献类型:Review; Early Access,ONCOLOGIST,10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0157,Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 After Gynecologic Oncology Surgery in Three Women: A Retrospective Review of Medical Records,"作者:Yang, SH (Yang, Shouhua)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yuan)[ 1 ] ; Cai, J (Cai, Jing)[ 1 ] ; Wang, ZH (Wang, Zehua)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Oncology,,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Union Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, 1277 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan 430022, Peoples R China.

Backgound To figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods A total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19 were studied. Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.

Results We found that COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury-related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation-related biomarkers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D-dimer, were significantly higher (P < .01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID-19.

Conclusions Our data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.",作者关键词:COVID-19; diabetes; prognosis,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DIABETES-METABOLISM RESEARCH AND REVIEWS,e3319,Diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19,"作者:Guo, WN (Guo, Weina)[ 1 ] ; Li, MY (Li, Mingyue)[ 1 ] ; Dong, YL (Dong, Yalan)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, HF (Zhou, Haifeng)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, ZL (Zhang, Zili)[ 1 ] ; Tian, CX (Tian, Chunxia)[ 1 ] ; Qin, RJ (Qin, Renjie)[ 1 ] ; Wang, HJ (Wang, Haijun)[ 2 ] ; Shen, Y (Shen, Yin)[ 2 ] ; Du, KY (Du, Keye)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Endocrinology & Metabolism,National Natural Science Foundation of China,10.1002/dmrr.3319,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Integrated Tradit Chinese & Western Med, Wuhan 430022, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The definite diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on the viral isolation or positive result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from sputum, or nasal swab, or throat swab. However, the sensitivity to detect COVID-19 of real time (RT)-PCR is reported to be lower than that of chest CT. We report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab. Chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3 days after admission, and it resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days after admission, and they resolved within 2 weeks. The fifth RT-PCR test finally revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission. It is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone; however, we emphasize the utility of chest CT to detect early change of COVID-19 in cases which RT-PCR tests show negative results.",作者关键词:COVID-19; 2019 corona virus disease; RT-PCR; real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction; CT; computed tomography; CXR; chest radiography,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s11604-020-00967-9,A case report of COVID-19 with false negative RT-PCR test: necessity of chest CT,"作者:Feng, H (Feng, Hao)[ 1,2 ] ; Liu, YJ (Liu, Yujian)[ 1,2 ] ; Lv, ML (Lv, Minli)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhong, JQ (Zhong, Jianquan)[ 1,2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,APR 2020,"Zigong First Peoples Hosp, Dept Radiol, Zigong 643000, Peoples R China.

Here, it is shown that there was community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 early in January.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December 2019. We re-analysed 640 throat swabs collected from patients in Wuhan with influenza-like-illness from 6 October 2019 to 21 January 2020 and found that 9 of the 640 throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative PCR, suggesting community transmission of SARS-CoV2 in Wuhan in early January 2020.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE MICROBIOLOGY,10.1038/s41564-020-0713-1,SARS-CoV-2 detection in patients with influenza-like illness,"作者:Kong, WH (Kong, Wen-Hua)[ 1 ] ; Li, Y (Li, Yao)[ 1 ] ; Peng, MW (Peng, Ming-Wei)[ 1 ] ; Kong, DG (Kong, De-Guang)[ 1 ] ; Yang, XB (Yang, Xiao-Bing)[ 1 ] ; Wang, LY (Wang, Leyi)[ 2 ] ; Liu, MQ (Liu, Man-Qing)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Microbiology,Emergency Scientific Research Project for COVID-19 from Wuhan City ,APR 2020,"Wuhan Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea.

Methods: All of the cases confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction were enrolled from the 1st to the 28th patient nationwide. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness.

Results: The median age was 40 years (range, 20-73 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male. The most common symptoms were cough (28.6 0 /0) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%). Diarrhea was not common (10.7 0 /0). Two patients had no symptoms. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients. Six patients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation. Lymphopenia was more common in severe cases. Higher level of C-reactive protein and worsening of chest radiographic score was observed during the 5-7 day period after symptom onset. Viral shedding was high from day 1 of illness, especially from the tipper respiratory tract (URT).

Conclusion: The prodromal symptoms of COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity. Viral shedding from URT was high from the prodromal phase. Radiological pneumonia was common from the early days of illness, but it was frequently not evident in simple CXR. These findings could be plausible explanations for the easy and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Viral Pneumonia; Prognosis; Cohort Study; Republic of Korea,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e142,Clinical Course and Outcomes of Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: a Preliminary Report of the First 28 Patients from the Korean Cohort Study on COVID-19,"作者:Kim, ES (Kim, Eu Suk)[ 1 ] ; Chin, BS (Chin, Bum Sik)[ 2 ] ; Kang, CK (Kang, Chang Kyung)[ 3 ] ; Kim, NJ (Kim, Nam Joong)[ 3 ] ; Kang, YM (Kang, Yu Min)[ 4 ] ; Choi, JP (Choi, Jae-Phil)[ 5 ] ; Oh, DH (Oh, Dong Hyun)[ 5 ] ; Kim, JH (Kim, Jeong-Han)[ 6 ] ; Koh, B (Koh, Boram)[ 7 ] ; Kim, SE (Kim, Seong Eun)[ 8 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,National Health Promotion Fund ,出版年: APR 6 2020,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Internal Med, Coll Med, 103 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea.

"摘要
Background: Nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy is significantly important to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure. The Ministry of Education decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size. We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic.

Methods: The potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19). Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered. The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from February 16 to March 22. The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening.

Results: Assuming the transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and approximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23. After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6 for 14 days.

Conclusion: The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education. After March 23, although the possibility of massive transmission in the children's age group is lower, group transmission is possible to occur.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Mathematical Modeling; Behavior Changes; School Opening Delay; School Closures,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e143,School Opening Delay Effect on Transmission Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea: Based on Mathematical Modeling and Simulation Study,"作者:Kim, S (Kim, Soyoung)[ 1 ] ; Kim, YJ (Kim, Yae Jean)[ 2 ] ; Peck, KR (Peck, Kyong Ran)[ 3 ] ; Jung, E (Jung, Eunok)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,Korea National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean government (MEST) ,出版年: APR 6 2020,"Konkuk Univ, Dept Math, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05029, South Korea.

"摘要
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a worldwide pandemic. Less than 6 weeks after the first confirmed cases in Korea, the patient number exceeded 5,000, which overcrowded limited hospital resources and forced confirmed patients to stay at home. To allocate medical resources efficiently, Korea implemented a novel institution for the purpose of treating patients with cohort isolation out of hospital, namely the Community Treatment Center (CTC). Herein, we report results of the initial management of patients at one of the largest CTC in Korea. A total of 309 patients were admitted to our CTC. During the first two weeks, 7 patients were transferred to the hospital because of symptom aggravation and 107 patients were discharged without any complication. Although it is a novel concept and may have some limitations, CTC may be a very cost-effective and resource-saving strategy in managing massive cases of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.",作者关键词:Community Treatment Center; Medical Resources; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e140,Out-of-Hospital Cohort Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients with Mild Symptoms in Korea: an Experience from a Single Community Treatment Center,"作者:Park, PG (Park, Peong Gang)[ 1 ] ; Kim, CH (Kim, Chang Hyup)[ 2 ] ; Heo, Y (Heo, Yoon)[ 3 ] ; Kim, TS (Kim, Tae Suk)[ 4 ] ; Park, CW (Park, Chan Woo)[ 5 ] ; Kim, CH (Kim, Choong-Hyo)[ 6 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 6 2020,"Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sch Med, 1 Gangwondaehak Ro, Chunchon 24289, South Korea.

"摘要
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in the city of Wuhan in China and has widely spread worldwide. Currently, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusively, this study suggests that pangolin species are a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs.",,文献类型:Article,CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.022,Probable Pangolin Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Associated with the COVID-19 Outbreak,"作者:Zhang, T (Zhang, Tao)[ 1 ] ; Wu, QF (Wu, Qunfu)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, ZG (Zhang, Zhigang)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program ,出版年: APR 6 2020,"Yunnan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources Y, 2 North Cuihu Rd, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In December 2019, an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to worldwide, which has attracted many people's concerns about the patients. However, studies on the infection status of medical personnel is still lacking. A total of 54 cases of SARS-Cov-2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between 7 January and 11 February 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method. From 7 January to 11 February 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%). Among the 54 patients with COVID-19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non-severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P = .0015). However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups. Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS-Cov-2 infected lungs with severe-/critical-type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs 0%; P = .028) and right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P = .012). Based on our findings with medical staff infection data, we suggest training for all hospital staff to prevent infection and preparation of sufficient protection and disinfection materials.",作者关键词:COVID-19 patients; medical staff; nucleic acid-negative; nucleic acid-positive; SARS-Cov-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25793,"Clinical characteristics of 54 medical staff with COVID-19: A retrospective study in a single center in Wuhan, China","作者:Chu, JJ (Chu, Jiaojiao)[ 1 ] ; Yang, N (Yang, Nan)[ 2 ] ; Wei, YQ (Wei, Yanqiu)[ 1 ] ; Yue, HH (Yue, Huihui)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, FQ (Zhang, Fengqin)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, JP (Zhao, Jianping)[ 1 ] ; He, L (He, Li)[ 3 ] ; Sheng, GH (Sheng, Gaohong)[ 4 ] ; Chen, P (Chen, Peng)[ 5,6 ] ; Li, G (Li, Gang)[ 7 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,Clinical Research Physician Program of Tongji Medical College ,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, NHC Key Lab Resp Dis, Tongji Med Coll, Tongji Hosp,Ctr Biomed Res,Dept Resp & Crit Care, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in January 2020, more than 100 cases of pregnant Chinese women have been published, including individuals with gestational diabetes (GDM). The descriptive overview reports on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 as well as on obstetric and neonatal outcome data. The main symptoms of the overall milder course of infection are fever, cough and dyspnea. So far, there is no evidence of intrauterine transmission of the virus and no evidence of breast milk transfer. Postnatal infections of infants of infected mothers are documented, but the course is usually mild. The available data are informative for preparing health professionals for the expected infections in pregnant women with the comorbidity diabetes mellitus.",作者关键词:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Reproduction; Pneumonia; Infectious disease transmission; vertical; Infant; newborn; diseases,文献类型:Article,DIABETOLOGE,10.1007/s11428-020-00611-0,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy Overview and report of the first German case with COVID-19 and gestational diabetes,"作者:Kleinwechter, H (Kleinwechter, H.)[ 1 ] ; Laubner, K (Laubner, K.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Endocrinology & Metabolism,,出版年: MAY 2020,"Diabetologikum Kiel, Diabet Schwerpunktpraxis & Schulungszentrum, Alter Markt 11, D-24103 Kiel, Germany.

"摘要
Background Since the first case of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Southwest China. The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. Methods In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. Results A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. Conclusion Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; The chest; Computed tomography; Pneumonia; Evolvement,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,154,CT imaging changes of corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19): a multi-center study in Southwest China,"作者:Li, XM (Li, Xiaoming)[ 1 ] ; Zeng, WB (Zeng, Wenbing)[ 2 ] ; Li, X (Li, Xiang)[ 2 ] ; Chen, HN (Chen, Haonan)[ 2 ] ; Shi, LP (Shi, Linping)[ 3 ] ; Li, XH (Li, Xinghui)[ 4 ] ; Xiang, HN (Xiang, Hongnian)[ 5 ] ; Cao, Y (Cao, Yang)[ 6 ] ; Chen, H (Chen, Hui)[ 1 ] ; Liu, C (Liu, Chen)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,Chongqing Key technology and application demonstration of medical imaging depth intelligent diagnostic platform ,出版年: APR 6 2020,"Army Med Univ, Dept Radiol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Chongqing, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue.

Methods: This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey. The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form. We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey. We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically.

Results: A total of 346 anesthesiology specialists and residents participated in the study. Although the majority of the participants exhibited the correct attitudes toward airway management, research assistants with little professional experience were observed to be undecided or had the tendency to make incorrect decisions.

Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide. The incidence of COVID-19 cases is increasing daily, and this disease can cause patient death. Anesthesiology specialists and residents who perform emergency operations on these patients in settings other than intensive care units should follow simple and easy-to-understand algorithms to ensure safety. The provision of theoretical and practical training to healthcare providers before they meet patients will help ensure patient-healthcare provider safety and prevent panic, which can cause distress among healthcare providers.",作者关键词:anesthesiology; intensive care; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,SURGICAL INFECTIONS,10.1089/sur.2020.097,Attitudes of Anesthesiology Specialists and Residents Toward Patients Infected with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A National Survey Study,"作者:Dost, B (Dost, Burhan)[ 1 ] ; Koksal, E (Koksal, Ersin)[ 1 ] ; Terzi, O (Terzi, Ozlem)[ 2 ] ; Bilgin, S (Bilgin, Sezgin)[ 1 ] ; Ustun, YB (Ustun, Yasemin Burcu)[ 1 ] ; Arslan, HN (Arslan, Hatice Nilden)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Surgery,,APR 2020,"Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anaesthesiol & Reanimat, Samsun, Turkey.

"摘要
Objective To investigate the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Methods Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). Results A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001). Conclusion Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Anosmia; Smell; Hyposmia; Dysgeusia; Taste; Loss; Gustatory; Olfactory; Olfaction; Infection; ENT,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY,10.1007/s00405-020-05965-1,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as a clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate forms of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a multicenter European study,"作者:Lechien, JR (Lechien, Jerome R.)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Chiesa-Estomba, CM (Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M.)[ 1,5 ] ; De Siati, DR (De Siati, Daniele R.)[ 1,6 ] ; Horoi, M (Horoi, Mihaela)[ 4 ] ; Le Bon, SD (Le Bon, Serge D.)[ 4 ] ; Rodriguez, A (Rodriguez, Alexandra)[ 4 ] ; Dequanter, D (Dequanter, Didier)[ 4 ] ; Blecic, S (Blecic, Serge)[ 7 ] ; El Afia, F (El Afia, Fahd)[ 1,3 ] ; Distinguin, L (Distinguin, Lea)[ 1,3 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Otorhinolaryngology,,APR 2020,"YO IFOS, COVID Task Force 19, Paris, France.

"摘要
Few children have been reported to have been affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); it is unclear whether children are less likely to be infected or rather display fewer symptoms. We present the case of a 32-day-old boy infected by COVID-19 that presented with an upper air way infection which resolved spontaneously and did not require any therapy. We argue that in epidemic settings children presenting with any mild symptom potentially attributable to COVID-19 should be considered contagious until proven otherwise, and that management must be guided by clinical conditions.",作者关键词:coronavirus; coronavirus disease 19; COVID-19; epidemic; epidemiology; infant; paediatric; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral infections,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY,10.1002/ppul.24754,COVID-19 infection in a paucisymptomatic infant: Raising the index of suspicion in epidemic settings,"作者:Canarutto, D (Canarutto, Daniele)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Priolo, A (Priolo, Alessio)[ 1 ] ; Russo, G (Russo, Gianni)[ 4 ] ; Pitea, M (Pitea, Marco)[ 4 ] ; Vigone, MC (Vigone, Maria Cristina)[ 4 ] ; Barera, G (Barera, Graziano)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics; Respiratory System,,APR 2020,"Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Fac Med & Surg, Via Olgettina 58, I-20132 Milan, Italy.

Aims Analyze the relationship between obesity and influenza. Methods Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. Results Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise. Conclusions Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.",作者关键词:Obese subjects; COVID-19; Influenza; Immune-modulation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ACTA DIABETOLOGICA,10.1007/s00592-020-01522-8,Influenza and obesity: its odd relationship and the lessons for COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Luzi, L (Luzi, Livio)[ 1,2 ] ; Radaelli, MG (Radaelli, Maria Grazia)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Endocrinology & Metabolism,Italian Ministry of Health-Ricerca Corrente-IRCCS Multimedica ,APR 2020,"IRCCS MultiMed, Dept Endocrinol Nutr & Metab Dis, Milan, Italy.

"摘要
This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the possible mechanisms. ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2-Ang 1-7-MasR counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans. ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes. ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury. Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (>60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.",作者关键词:acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); renin-angiotensin system (RAS); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25785,Organ-protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and its effect on the prognosis of COVID-19,"作者:Cheng, H (Cheng, Hao)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, Y (Wang, Yan)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, GQ (Wang, Gui-Qiang)[ 1,2,3,4 ]",研究方向:Virology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,APR 2020,"Peking Univ, Dept Infect Dis, Hosp 1, 8 Xishiku St, Beijing 100034, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In this study, we collected a total of 610 hospitalized patients from Wuhan between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020. We reported a potentially high false negative rate of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2019 outbreak. We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic. These results suggested the urgent needs for the standard of procedures of sampling from different anatomic sites, sample transportation, optimization of RT-PCR, serology diagnosis/screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and distinct diagnosis from other respiratory diseases such as fluenza infections as well.",作者关键词:COVID-19; RT-PCR,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25786,Stability issues of RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19,"作者:Li, YF (Li, Yafang)[ 1 ] ; Yao, L (Yao, Lin)[ 2 ] ; Li, JW (Li, Jiawei)[ 3 ] ; Chen, L (Chen, Lei)[ 1 ] ; Song, YY (Song, Yiyan)[ 4 ] ; Cai, ZF (Cai, Zhifang)[ 5 ] ; Yang, CH (Yang, Chunhua)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,Science and Technology Planning Projects of Guangzhou City ,APR 2020,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 6, Dept Intens Care Unit, 26th Yuancun Rd 2, Guangzhou 510655, Peoples R China.

The elderly in long-term care (LTC) and their caregiving staff are at elevated risk from COVID-19. Outbreaks in LTC facilities can threaten the health care system. COVID-19 suppression should focus on testing and infection control at LTC facilities. Policies should also be developed to ensure that LTC facilities remain adequately staffed and that infection control protocols are closely followed. Family will not be able to visit LTC facilities, increasing isolation and vulnerability to abuse and neglect. To protect residents and staff, supervision of LTC facilities should remain a priority during the pandemic.",作者关键词:Aging; housing for the elderly; COVID-19; long-term care; infection control; elder abuse; elder neglect,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,JOURNAL OF AGING & SOCIAL POLICY,10.1080/08959420.2020.1750543,The Coronavirus and the Risks to the Elderly in Long-Term Care,"作者:Gardner, W (Gardner, William)[ 1 ] ; States, D (States, David)[ 2 ] ; Bagley, N (Bagley, Nicholas)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Geriatrics & Gerontology,,APR 2020,"CHEO Res Inst, 401 Smyth Rd, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada.

"摘要
Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. No vaccine or approved drug is available to eradicate the virus, however, some drugs that are indicated for other afflictions seems to be potentially beneficial to treat the infection albeit without unequivocal evidence. The aim of this article is to review the published background on the effectiveness of these drugs against COVID-19 Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted on recently published studies which have published between January 1 to March 25, 2020. PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases were searched Results: A total 22 articles were found eligible. 8 discuss about treatment outcomes from their applied drugs during treatment of COVID-19 patients, 4 report laboratory tests, one report animal trial and other 9 articles discuss recommendations and suggestions based on the treatment process and clinical outcomes of other diseases such as malaria, ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The data and/or recommendations are categorized in 4 classes: (a) anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drugs, (b) anti-malaria drugs, (c) traditional Chinese drugs and (d) other treatments/drugs. Conclusion: All examined treatments, although potentiality effective against COVID-19, need either appropriate drug development or clinical trial to be suitable for clinical use.",,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,APR 4 2020,Current Drugs with Potential for Treatment of COVID-19: A Literature Review,"作者:Rabby, MII (Rabby, Md Insiat Islam)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,出版年: APR 4 2020,"Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Serdang, Malaysia.

"摘要
Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA.

Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested.

Findings Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from China in mid-January, 2020. 1 week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV- 2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Interpretation Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.",,文献类型:Article,LANCET,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30607-3,First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA,"作者:Ghinai, I (Ghinai, Isaac)[ 1,7 ] ; McPherson, TD (McPherson, Tristan D.)[ 1,8 ] ; Hunter, JC (Hunter, Jennifer C.)[ 2 ] ; Kirking, HL (Kirking, Hannah L.)[ 3 ] ; Christiansen, D (Christiansen, Demian)[ 9 ] ; Joshi, K (Joshi, Kiran)[ 9 ] ; Rubin, R (Rubin, Rachel)[ 9 ] ; Morales-Estrada, S (Morales-Estrada, Shirley)[ 9 ] ; Black, SR (Black, Stephanie R.)[ 8 ] ; Pacilli, M (Pacilli, Massimo)[ 8 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 4 2020,"Chicago Dept Publ Hlth, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.

"摘要
This opinion article discusses the increasing attention paid to the role of activating damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in initiation of inflammatory diseases and suppressing/inhibiting DAMPs (SAMPs) in resolution of inflammatory diseases and, consequently, to the future roles of these novel biomarkers as therapeutic targets and therapeutics. Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration and repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled. Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes. For example, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent ""homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio"" in each case and a ""homeostatic window"" of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee a safe treatment modality to patients. Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS & THERAPY,10.1007/s40291-020-00460-z,Use of DAMPs and SAMPs as Therapeutic Targets or Therapeutics: A Note of Caution,"作者:Land, WG (Land, Walter Gottlieb)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Genetics & Heredity; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,APR 2020,"Univ Strasbourg, Lab Excellence Transplantex, INSERM UMR S1109, Mol ImmunoRheumatol, Strasbourg, France.

"摘要
A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused outbreaks in multiple countries and the number of cases is rapidly increasing through human-to-human transmission. Clinical phenomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical in distinguishing it from other respiratory infections. The extent and characteristics of those phenomes varied depending on the severities of the infection, for example, beginning with fever or a mild cough, progressed with signs of pneumonia, and worsened with severe or even fatal respiratory difficulty in acute respiratory distress syndrome. We summarized clinical phenomes of 3795 patients with COVID-19 based on 80 published reports from the onset of outbreak to March 2020 to emphasize the importance and specificity of those phenomes in diagnosis and treatment of infection, and evaluate the impact on medical services. The data show that the incidence of male patients was higher than that of females and the level of C-reaction protein was increased as well as most patients' imaging included ground-glass opacity. Clinical phenomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. There is an urgent need to develop an artificial intelligence-based machine learning capacity to analyze and integrate radiomics- or imaging-based, patient-based, clinician-based, and molecular measurements-based data to fight the outbreak of COVID-19 and enable more efficient responses to unknown infections in future.",作者关键词:acute lung injury; clinical phenome; COVID-19; lung,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,10.1002/ctm2.17,Significance of clinical phenomes of patients with COVID-19 infection: A learning from 3795 patients in 80 reports,"作者:Zhang, LL (Zhang, Linlin)[ 1 ] ; Wang, DNC (Wang, Diane C.)[ 2 ] ; Huang, QH (Huang, Qihong)[ 1 ] ; Wang, XD (Wang, Xiangdong)[ 1,3,4,5 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Shanghai Institute of Clinical Bioinformatics ,APR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Sch, Inst Clin Sci, Zhongshan Hosp, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the imaging manifestations of early-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to provide imaging basis for early detection of suspected cases and stratified intervention.

Material/Methods: From 20 January 2020 to 2 February 2020, 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 male and 5 females, were retrospectively reviewed in Zhejiang Hospital. These cases were clinically assessed and classified as common COVID-19. All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records.

Results: CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected. Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements and 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement. Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions. There were 2 cases (33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle. Five cases (83.3%) had ground-glass opacities, 4 cases (66.7%) had ground-glass nodules, 1 case (16.7%) had thickened lobular septum, 2 cases (33.3%) had thickened bronchial wall, 2 cases (33.3%) had halo sign, 1 case (16.7%) had crazy-paving sign, and 1 case (16.7%) had tree-in-bud sign.

Conclusions: The imaging manifestations of early-stage COVID-19 are relatively mild, and the imaging findings of some patients are not typical, which can easily lead to missed diagnoses. Thus, suspected cases need to be closely monitored, and epidemiological history and clinical laboratory examination should also be considered during diagnosis.","作者关键词:Coronavirus Infections; COVID-19; neumonia, Viral; X-Ray Computed Tomography",文献类型:Article,MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,e923885,"Pulmonary High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) Findings of Patients with Early-Stage Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hangzhou, China","作者:Gao, LL (Gao, Lulu)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, JJ (Zhang, Jianjun)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,,出版年: APR 4 2020,"Zhejiang Hosp, Dept Radiol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

"摘要
This study implements a computer-assisted content analysis to identify which social grooming factors reduce social media users' incivility when commenting or posting about the COVID-19 situation in South Korea. In addition, this study conducts semantic network analysis to interpret qualitatively how people express their thoughts. The findings suggest that social network size is a negative predictor of incivility. Moreover, Twitter users who have built larger networks and gained positive responses from others are less likely to use uncivil language. Lastly, linguistic choice among users is different depending on the size of their social network.",作者关键词:incivility; network analysis; COVID-19; Corona19; social grooming; big data,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,10.1089/cyber.2020.0201,Effects of Social Grooming on Incivility in COVID-19,"作者:Kim, B (Kim, Bumsoo)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Psychology,,APR 2020,"Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.

Objectives To assess the status of health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic in China and to evaluate the regional difference of telehealth. Materials and methods The health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals in China mainland during the COVID-19 epidemic was inquired. The status of non-emergency dental services, emergency dental services, and online professional consultation and the hospitals' geographical distribution were recorded and analyzed. Results All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only. Ninety percent of them notified the change of dental services online, and 69% of them offered free online professional consultations. The penetration rate of online technology was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of the central and western regions.

"摘要
Objective To outline strategies for the treatment of migraine which do not require in-person visits to clinic or the emergency department, and to describe ways that health insurance companies can remove barriers to quality care for migraine.

Background COVID-19 is a global pandemic causing widespread infections and death. To control the spread of infection we are called to observe ""social distancing"" and we have been asked to postpone any procedures which are not essential. Since procedural therapies are a mainstay of headache care, the inability to do procedures could negatively affect our patients with migraine. In this manuscript we review alternative therapies, with particular attention to those which may be contra-indicated in the setting of COVID-19 infection.

Design/Results The manuscript reviews the use of telemedicine visits and acute, bridge, and preventive therapies for migraine. We focus on evidence-based treatment where possible, but also describe ""real world"" strategies which may be tried. In each section we call out areas where changes to rules from commercial health insurance companies would facilitate better migraine care.

Conclusions Our common goal as health care providers is to maximize the health and safety of our patients. Successful management of migraine with avoidance of in-person clinic and emergency department visits further benefits the current urgent societal goal of maintaining social distance to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.",作者关键词:migraine; COVID-19; treatment; telemedicine,文献类型:Article; Early Access,HEADACHE,10.1111/head.13810,Migraine Care in the Era of COVID-19: Clinical Pearls and Plea to Insurers,"作者:Szperka, CL (Szperka, Christina L.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ailani, J (Ailani, Jessica)[ 4 ] ; Barmherzig, R (Barmherzig, Rebecca)[ 1 ] ; Klein, BC (Klein, Brad C.)[ 5,6 ] ; Minen, MT (Minen, Mia T.)[ 7,8 ] ; Singh, RBH (Singh, Rashmi B.

"摘要
BACKGROUND ""Action at a distance"" may be the new norm for clinical researchers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that may require social distancing for the next 18 months. We must minimize face-to-face contact with vulnerable populations. But we must also persist, adapt, and help our older patients and study participants during the pandemic.

METHODS Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can. Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.

RESULTS Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools such as e-mailed surveys or telehealth assessments.

Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities? Are their healthcare needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends.

Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely and reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers.

CONCLUSIONS We have an opportunity to make an impact on our older adult patients now as this pandemic continues to unfold. Above all, clinical researchers need to continue working, to help as many people as possible through the crisis.",作者关键词:clinical research; mobile health; social isolation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY,10.1111/jgs.16443,Action at a Distance: Geriatric Research during a Pandemic,"作者:Nicol, GE (Nicol, Ginger E.)[ 1 ] ; Piccirillo, JF (Piccirillo, Jay F.)[ 2 ] ; Mulsant, BH (Mulsant, Benoit H.)[ 3,4 ] ; Lenze, EJ (Lenze, Eric J.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Geriatrics & Gerontology,,APR 2020,"Washington Univ, Sch Med, Hlth Mind Lab, 600 S Taylor Ave,Suite 121, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.

"摘要
Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy, the difference of coagulation features between severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 and non-SARS-CoV2 has not been analyzed. Coagulation results and clinical features of consecutive patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 (COVID group) and non-SARS-CoV2 (non-COVID group) in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed and compared. Whether patients with elevated D-dimer could benefit from anticoagulant treatment was evaluated. There were 449 COVID patients and 104 non-COVID patients enrolled into the study. The 28-day mortality in COVID group was approximately twofold of mortality in non-COVID group (29.8% vs. 15.4%, P = 0.003), COVID group were older (65.1 +/- 12.0 vs. 58.4 +/- 18.0, years, P < 0.001) and with higher platelet count (215 +/- 100 vs. 188 +/- 98, x10(9)/L, P = 0.015), comparing to non-COVID group. The 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In COVID group with D-dimer > 3.0 mu g/mL (32.8% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.017). Patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 had higher platelet count than those induced by non-SARS-CoV2, and only the former with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant treatment.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease 2019; Severe pneumonia; Coagulopathy; D-dimer,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS,10.1007/s11239-020-02105-8,Difference of coagulation features between severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 and non-SARS-CoV2,"作者:Yin, SY (Yin, Shiyu)[ 1 ] ; Huang, M (Huang, Ming)[ 2 ] ; Li, DJ (Li, Dengju)[ 3 ] ; Tang, N (Tang, Ning)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Hematology,National Mega Project on Major infectious Disease Prevention of China ,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Clin Lab, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

The current COVID-19 pandemic is associated with unprecedented morbidity and mortality. Early reports suggested an association between disease severity and hypertension but did not account for sources of confounding.

"摘要
In December 2019, COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbroke in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China. The disease rapidly spread to other areas in China due to a huge population movement during the New Year Festival. Here, a 7-year-old child with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Chongqing, outside of Wuhan, Hubei province, was reported. This case suggested that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to present milder manifestations than adults. The continuous positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the child's throat swab sample indicated the isolation period for suspected child cases should be longer than 14 days.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY,10.1002/ppul.24763,"The isolation period should be longer: Lesson from a child infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Chongqing, China","作者:Lin, JL (Lin, Jilei)[ 1 ] ; Duan, J (Duan, Jun)[ 2 ] ; Tan, TD (Tan, Tingdan)[ 2 ] ; Fu, Z (Fu, Zhou)[ 1 ] ; Dai, JH (Dai, Jihong)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics; Respiratory System,,APR 2020,"Chongqing Med Univ, China Int Sci & Technol Cooperat Base Child Dev &, Natl Clin Res Ctr Child Hlth & Disorders,Key Lab, Chongqing Key Lab Pediat,Childrens Hosp,Minist Ed, Chongqing 400000, Peoples R China.

OBJECTIVES

To outline which infectious diseases in the precovid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province.

DESIGN

National surveillance studies, 2008-17.

SETTING

31 provinces in mainland China.

PARTICIPANTS

4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases.

RESULTS

From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases.

CONCLUSION

China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.",,文献类型:Article,BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL,m1043,Infectious diseases in children and adolescents in China: analysis of national surveillance data from 2008 to 2017,"作者:Dong, YH (Dong, Yanhui)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, LP (Wang, Liping)[ 3 ] ; Burgner, DP (Burgner, David P.)[ 4,5 ] ; Miller, JE (Miller, Jessica E.)[ 4,5 ] ; Song, Y (Song, Yi)[ 1,2 ] ; Ren, X (Ren, Xiang)[ 3 ] ; Li, ZJ (Li, Zhongjie)[ 3 ] ; Xing, Y (Xing, Yi)[ 1,2 ] ; Ma, J (Ma, Jun)[ 1,2 ] ; Sawyer, SM (Sawyer, Susan M.)[ 4,5,6 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,"Ministry of Science and Technology, China",出版年: APR 2 2020,"Peking Univ, Inst Child & Adolescent Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.

Here we link replication of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-causing virus, with cytoskeleton-dependent signalling and 3D genome organization.

"摘要
Understanding risk perceptions of the public is critical for risk communication. In February 2020, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare started collecting weekly qualitative data on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) risk perception that informs risk communication efforts. The process is based on thematic analysis of emails and social media messages from the public and identifies factors linked to appraisal of risk magnitude, which are developed into risk communication recommendations together with health and communication experts.",,文献类型:Article,EUROSURVEILLANCE,10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.13.2000317,"Understanding coronavirus disease (COVID-19) risk perceptions among the public to enhance risk communication efforts: a practical approach for outbreaks, Finland, February 2020","作者:Lohiniva, AL (Lohiniva, Anna-Leena)[ 1 ] ; Sane, J (Sane, Jussi)[ 1 ] ; Sibenberg, K (Sibenberg, Katja)[ 1 ] ; Puumalainen, T (Puumalainen, Taneli)[ 1 ] ; Salminen, M (Salminen, Mika)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare ,出版年: APR 2 2020,"Finnish Inst Hlth & Welf, Helsinki, Finland.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a significant threat to global health. It caused a total of 80 868 confirmed cases and 3101 deaths in Chinese mainland until March 8, 2020. This novel virus spread mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. As disease progressed, a series of complications tend to develop, especially in critically ill patients. Pathological findings showed representative features of acute respiratory distress syndrome and involvement of multiple organs. Apart from supportive care, no specific treatment has been established for COVID-19. The efficacy of some promising antivirals, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials.",作者关键词:coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; pathology; radiology; clinical characteristics; treatment,文献类型:Review; Early Access,FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11684-020-0767-8,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a clinical update,"作者:Zhou, M (Zhou, Min)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhang, XX (Zhang, Xinxin)[ 1,4,5 ] ; Qu, JM (Qu, Jieming)[ 1,2,3 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,innovative research team of high-level local universities in Shanghai ,APR 2020,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Ruijin Hosp, Natl Res Ctr Translat Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.

In the Chinese coronavirus epicenter, Wuhan, 16 cabin hospitals were built to admit patients with confirmed coronavirus infection (COVID-19). These cabin hospitals serve the role of effectively quarantine and treat mild cases of patients infected with COVID-19. Each cabin hospital has pharmacists to provide services and pharmaceutical care to patients. Pharmacists also provide assistance to cabin hospitals through remote internet platforms across China. In this commentary, we describe pharmacy services at cabin hospitals to share our experiences with the international pharmacy community.",作者关键词:Cabin hospital; China; COVID-19; Pharmaceutical care; Pharmacists; Pharmacy service,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY,10.1007/s11096-020-01020-5,Providing pharmacy services at cabin hospitals at the coronavirus epicenter in China,"作者:Meng, L (Meng, Long)[ 1 ] ; Qiu, F (Qiu, Feng)[ 1 ] ; Sun, SS (Sun, Shusen)[ 2,3,4 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,APR 2020,"Chongqing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Pharm, Chongqing 400016, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate of phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks.

Objective: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or >= 58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or ""other""), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020.

Results: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between 15,000 pound and 74,999 pound. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was ""highly effective"" in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusions: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.",作者关键词:rapid online surveys; perceptions; knowledge; coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; pandemic; infectious disease; outbreak; survey; COVID-19; public health,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,e18790,Use of Rapid Online Surveys to Assess People's Perceptions During Infectious Disease Outbreaks: A Cross-sectional Survey on COVID-19,"作者:Geldsetzer, P (Geldsetzer, Pascal)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

"摘要
This contribution discusses the two main asymmetries of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) as they developed over the past two decades since the launch of the Single Currency. From the outset, EMU involved asymmetric degrees of integration in the area of 'economic' union (less centralised governance) versus 'monetary' union (more supranational governance). With the outbreak of the Sovereign Debt Crisis in 2010, the regime-shaping relevance of a second asymmetry emerged: one roughly between the member states of the Euro Area 'core' and those in the 'periphery'. Each of the two asymmetries have created a range of challenges - institutional, policy and political - that undermine the stability and sustainability of the EMU project.",作者关键词:Economic and Monetary Union; asymmetry; European integration; euro area; Sovereign Debt Crisis; Coronavirus (Covid-19) Crisis; European integration theory,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION,10.1080/07036337.2020.1730348,Economic and Monetary Union at twenty: a stocktaking of a tumultuous second decade: introduction,"作者:Howarth, D (Howarth, David)[ 1 ] ; Verdun, A (Verdun, Amy)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:International Relations; Government & Law,Institute of Political Science at Leiden University ,出版年: APR 2 2020,"Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, POB 9500, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.

"摘要
Since the first case was contracted by coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Daegu, Korea in February 2020, about 6,800 cases and 130 deaths have been reported on April 9, 2020. Recent studies have reported that patients with diabetes showed higher mortality and they had a worse prognosis than the group without diabetes. In poorly controlled patients with diabetes, acute hyperglycemic crises such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) also might be precipitated by COVID-19. Thus, intensive monitoring and aggressive supportive care should be needed to inadequately controlled patients with diabetes and COVID-19 infection.

"摘要
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks, first in the Wuhan region of China and then spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral life cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

"摘要
It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were <10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI. However, further study and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.

"摘要
Background: Since December 2019, a number of patients infected with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) have been identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China. As the epidemic has spread, similar cases have also been found in other parts of mainland China and abroad. The main reason for this spread is the highly contagious nature of the virus and the fact that children can also become infected during its incubation period. This has made the virus a substantial challenge for the outpatient triage staff of children's hospitals outside the epidemic area of the Hubei Province. It is very important for the preview and triage personnel to accurately grasp the epidemiology of the virus and identify children's symptoms in the fever clinic.

Methods: We performed an analysis of our early preview and triage of suspected COVID-19 in 36 children presenting at fever clinics. Two specialists either excluded suspected cases or referred cases to the isolation ward for new nucleic acid testing.

Results: All 14 children who were transferred to the isolation ward had a fever, and 71.43% of them had a cough. Their nucleic acid testing results were negative. The suspected cases and excluded suspected cases had similar epidemiology history as well as complete blood count results. With reference to the diagnostic criteria in existing pediatric guidelines, we have further improved the triage screening questionnaire for children with fever in our hospital.

Conclusions: According to the situation in our city and hospital, an evaluation questionnaire that is suitable for use with children in our hospital has been formulated to achieve the goals of early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment. We provided an important basis for the next step in developing accurate preview and triage screening standards and appropriate guidelines for pediatric patients.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; children; preview and triage,文献类型:Article,TRANSLATIONAL PEDIATRICS,10.21037/tp.2020.03.08,Analysis and suggestions for the preview and triage screening of children with suspected COVID-19 outside the epidemic area of Hubei Province,"作者:Zhang, N (Zhang, Ni)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Deng, YB (Deng, Yuebi)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Li, WG (Li, Weiguo)[ 2,3,4 ] ; Liu, JH (Liu, Junhong)[ 2,3,5 ] ; Li, HY (Li, Haiying)[ 2,3,6 ] ; Liu, EM (Liu, Enmei)[ 2,3,4 ] ; Zheng, XL (Zheng, Xianlan)[ 2,3,7 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,construction and popularization of the standardized model of pediatric integration outpatient service ,出版年: APR 2020,"Chongqing Med Univ, Childrens Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Chongqing 400014, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients.

Methods: We developed two 1-step quantitative real time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested.

Results: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range o f at least seven orders of magnitude (2 x 10(-)(4)-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests.

Conclusions: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.",,文献类型:Article,CLINICAL CHEMISTRY,10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029,Molecular Diagnosis of a Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia,"作者:Chu, DKW (Chu, Daniel K.

First reported in China, the 2019 novel coronavirus has been spreading across the globe. Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over. The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation. Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms. Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers. Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission. Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Guideline; Pandemic; SARI; Treatment,文献类型:Article,INDIAN PEDIATRICS,10.1007/s13312-020-1785-y,Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) Infection: Part I-Preparedness and Management in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in Resource-limited Settings,"作者:Ravikumar, N (Ravikumar, Namita)[ 1 ] ; Nallasamy, K (Nallasamy, Karthi)[ 1 ] ; Bansal, A (Bansal, Arun)[ 1 ] ; Angurana, SK (Angurana, Suresh Kumar)[ 1 ] ; Basavaraja, GV (Basavaraja, G.

"摘要
The 2019-novel coronavirus predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from upper respiratory symptoms to full blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment. Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases. Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus. Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia. At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol. We, herein, provide guidance on non-invasive respiratory support, intubation and management of ARDS in a child with COVID-19.",作者关键词:2019; nCoV; Aerosol generation; ARDS; Management; Pandemic; SARI,文献类型:Article,INDIAN PEDIATRICS,10.1007/s13312-020-1786-x,Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) Infection: Part II-Respiratory Support in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in Resource-limited Settings,"作者:Sundaram, M (Sundaram, Manu)[ 1 ] ; Ravikumar, N (Ravikumar, Namita)[ 2 ] ; Bansal, A (Bansal, Arun)[ 2 ] ; Nallasamy, K (Nallasamy, Karthi)[ 2 ] ; Basavaraja, GV (Basavaraja, G.

"摘要
An outbreak of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China in the late December.(1) Since then, the positive cases have increased exponentially to 1.4 million (as of 8 April 2020).(2) The ability of a country to cope with increasing number of Covid-19 testing is the ultimate test. Teaching/university hospitals should pull their resources and man-power to provide the much-needed assistance to the demand of Covid-19 testing. Inadequate testing could result in unrecognised Covid-19 infected individuals, roaming freely in the population. The other issue is the sensitivity of test if samples were obtained from different sites. Classically, the confirmation of diagnosis of Covid-19 depends on real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to detect viral genetic material in either a nasal swab or bronchioalveolar lavage sample. Wang et al. (2020) reported that bronchioalveolar lavage sample has the highest sensitivity in identifying Covid-19, followed by sputum and nasal swab with positive rates of 93%, 72% and 63%, respectively.(3) Furthermore, they found that nasal swab contained the highest concentration of viral load as it required less number of cycles to achieve higher copy numbers. In some patients, viral genetic material was also identified in faeces and blood.(3) While the reliability of testing is a concern, the safety of the laboratory staff also has to be kept in mind. In this issue, there are three review articles on Covid-19, first article described the general properties of coronavirus, second article described the diagnostic performance of Covid-19 serology assay and third article described the importance of the site of sampling for Covid-19.(4-6)",作者关键词:coronavirus; Covid-19; diagnostic testing; pathology,文献类型:Editorial Material,MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY,APR 2020,The challenges of Covid-19 testing: Time for Pathologists to rise to the occasion,"作者:Tan, GC (Tan, Geok Chin)[ 1 ] ; Cheong, SK (Cheong, Soon Keng)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Pathology,,出版年: APR 2020,"Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Med, Dept Pathol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 outbreak as a world pandemic on 12th March 2020. Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. Results: From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. Conclusions: There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway. The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests.",作者关键词:antibody; antigen; COVID-19; performance; SARS-CoV-2; rapid test; serology,文献类型:Review,MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY,APR 2020,Diagnostic performance of COVID-19 serology assays,"作者:Zainol Rashid, Z (Zainol Rashid, Zetti)[ 1 ] ; Othman, SN (Othman, Siti Norlia)[ 1 ] ; Abdul Samat, MN (Abdul Samat, Muttaqillah Najihan)[ 1 ] ; Ali, UK (Ali, Umi Kalsom)[ 1 ] ; Wong, KK (Wong, Kon Ken)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pathology,,出版年: APR 2020,"Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Med Ctr, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia.

Introduction: To review the present literature on upper respiratory tract sampling in COVID-19 and provide recommendations to improve healthcare practices and directions in future studies. Methods: Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2. Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors. The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. Results: The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. Recommendations: Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield. Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; swab; nasopharyngeal; oropharyngeal; viral; analysis; coronavirus,文献类型:Review,MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY,APR 2020,Upper respiratory tract sampling in COVID-19,"作者:Mawaddah, A (Mawaddah, Azman)[ 1 ] ; Gendeh, HS (Gendeh, Hardip Singh)[ 1 ] ; Lum, SG (Lum, Sai Guan)[ 1 ] ; Marina, MB (Marina, Mat Baki)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pathology,,出版年: APR 2020,"Pusat Perubatan Univ Kebangsaan, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Jalan Yaacob Latif, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia.

The COVID-19 epidemic hit everyone, professionals and civilians alike. The possibility of a worldwide pandemic has long been theorized by epidemiologists, infectologists on the one hand, and sociologists and behavioral scientists dealing with communication and social habits on the other. Yet, faced with real-time events, daily infections and mortality statistics, almost everyone feels uninformed or disturbingly inexperienced. This summary aims to provide an overview of the latest scientific evidences. Of course, the incomplete material, compiled in late March 2020, will certainly contain a few elements that likely will be outdated in a few weeks.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic probably started in China in 2019 and is influencing the whole healthcare system worldwide. As several healthcare interventions are essential even during pandemics, it is necessary for professionals working in such fields to get up-to-date information about the virus and its aspects that can influence patient care and suggested actions. The current article is a literature review, in which the authors elaborated the recently available scientific articles with their relevancy for clinical interventions as primary factor. The processed articles emphasize that during interventions in the head and neck region, especially when using rotating instruments, it is of utmost importance for all personnel being present at the time of intervention to wear full protection, including disposable medical uniforms, glasses and special masks. These single-use items have to be changed after each intervention and the whole team has to be educated for this process in advance. In order to avoid cross-contamination and infection of personnel during intervention, it is essential to keep all work-safety and infection-control precautions extremely strictly.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; dentistry; oral surgery; head and neck region,文献类型:Article,ORVOSI HETILAP,10.1556/650.2020.31806,Essential new information for the clinical recognition of COVID-19 infection and the prevention possibilities of healthcare personnel working in the head and neck region,"作者:Mark, A (Mark, Antal)[ 1 ] ; Magdolna, SR (Magdolna, Szabo Reka)[ 2 ] ; Zoltan, J (Zoltan, Juhasz)[ 2 ] ; Tamas, V (Tamas, Vereb)[ 3 ] ; Jozsef, P (Jozsef, Piffko)[ 3 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Tisza Lajos Krt 60-64, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary.

"摘要
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin occured in Wuhan, China. The identified infective agent is a novel corona virus called ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2) and the respiratory disease caused by this agent aquired the name ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. We reviewed the international literature regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak. Here below, we focus mainly on the diagnostic issues of COVID-19 and on the estimation of the prognosis. We detail the relevant anamnestic factors and initial examination results which serve as basics for the clinical suspicion of COVID-19. We also focus on the proper method of microbiological sampling and the relevant informations regarding diagnostic tests like the gold standard real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. We also cite the current national epidemiologic regulations of testing for novel coronavirus. In the last section, we emphasize the importance and the potential way of early identification of high-risk patients. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause substantial epidemiological and healthcare burden even in Hungary. In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality. The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care. It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries.",作者关键词:outbreak; pandemic; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; diagnostic testing; RT-PCR; high-risk patient; prognosis,文献类型:Article,ORVOSI HETILAP,10.1556/650.2020.31815,Diagnostic consideration and bedside estimation of the prognosis in COVID-19 patients,"作者:Anita, K (Anita, Korsos)[ 1 ] ; Szilvia, K (Szilvia, Kupcsulik)[ 1 ] ; Andras, L (Andras, Lovas)[ 1 ] ; Peter, H (Peter, Hankovszky)[ 1 ] ; Tamas, M (Tamas, Molnar)[ 1 ] ; Zsolt, S (Zsolt, Szabo)[ 1 ] ; Barna, B (Barna, Babik)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Semmelweis U 6, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary.

"摘要
Critical-care physicians are facing a challenging process in healthcare due to the overwhelming case number of hypoxic respiratory failure patients. Pneumonia has an utmost importance in the primary pathomechanism of the development of critical illness in the COVID-19 patients. Thus, imaging techniques are situated in the frontline to aim the diagnostic decision-making, to follow up the progress and to evaluate the possible complications. Reviewing the available literature, so far the common chest CT, chest X-ray and chest wall ultrasound features are presented, and recommendations are pronounced for the indications of the different modalities. At the initial phase, the atypical presentations of the virus infection are multiplex, peripheral ground glass opacities situated in the right lower lobe of the lung evolving rapidly into a bilateral involvement of the middle and basal zones. Along with the progression, the ratio of the consolidation is increasing subsequently deteriorating into fibrosis with reticular pattern. Chest ultrasound performed at the bedside has a paramount importance to reduce the possible number of health-care worker contacts in consequence of the strict and special infection control orders established on account of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemia.",作者关键词:computer tomography; chest X-ray; COVID-19; imaging; ultrasound diagnostics,文献类型:Article,ORVOSI HETILAP,10.1556/650.2020.31814,Importance of the imaging techniques in the management of COVID-19-infected patients,"作者:Andras, L (Andras, Lovas)[ 1 ] ; Peter, H (Peter, Hankovszky)[ 1 ] ; Anita, K (Anita, Korsos)[ 1 ] ; Szilvia, K (Szilvia, Kupcsulik)[ 1 ] ; Tamas, M (Tamas, Molnar)[ 1 ] ; Zsolt, S (Zsolt, Szabo)[ 1 ] ; Barna, B (Barna, Babik)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Semmelweis U 6, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary.

"摘要
Caring for those affected by the coronavirus outbreak of December 2019 imposed a heavy burden on healthcare systems.

Managing these cases is a major challenge for anesthesiologists. The purpose of this summary is to present the practical aspects of anesthetic and perioperative care for patients requiring surgical treatment.",作者关键词:COVID-19 disease; anesthesia; operation; perioperative care,文献类型:Article,ORVOSI HETILAP,10.1556/650.2020.31809,Practical aspects of anesthetic and perioperative care for COVID-19 patients,"作者:Tamas, V (Tamas, Vegh)[ 1 ] ; Istvan, L (Istvan, Laszlo)[ 1 ] ; Marianna, J (Marianna, Juhasz)[ 1 ] ; Mariann, B (Mariann, Berhes)[ 1 ] ; Akos, F (Akos, Fabian)[ 1 ] ; Gyorgy, K (Gyorgy, Koszta)[ 1 ] ; Csilla, M (Csilla, Molnar)[ 1 ] ; Bela, F (Bela, Fulesdi)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Nagyerdei Krt 98, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.

"摘要
In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the failure of the cardiorespiratory system can be due to one of the following: (1) cytokine storm, haemophagocytosis - septic shock, (2) unmanageable hypoxemia, (3) isolated organ failure or as part of multi-organ failure. Herein we give an overview of the therapeutic options for treating or preventing these disease states. In recent years, CytoSorb-haemoperfusion to remove cytokines has shown promising results in the treatment of septic shock. Inhalational nitric oxide (iNO), inhalational epoprostenol and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are options in severe hypoxemia that is unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation. Renal failure is a frequent component of the multi-organ failure usually seen with disease progression and necessitates starting one of the available continuous renal replacement modalities.",作者关键词:COVID-19; intensive therapy; CytoSorb; ECMO; inhalational nitric oxide,文献类型:Article,ORVOSI HETILAP,10.1556/650.2020.31813,Organ replacement therapy and life-supporting treatment modalities in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"作者:Mariann, B (Mariann, Berhes)[ 1 ] ; Akos, F (Akos, Fabian); Istvan, L (Istvan, Laszlo); Tamas, V (Tamas, Vegh); Csilla, M (Csilla, Molnar); Bela, F (Bela, Fulesdi); Gyorgy, K (Gyorgy, Koszta)",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Nagyerdei Krt 98, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.

"摘要
The coronavirus pandemic is a serious challenge for healthcare workers worldwide. The virus is spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze and it has a very high virulence. Procedures generating airway aerosols are dangerous for every participant of patient care. Mortality of COVID-19 is above 10%, thus cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an often needed intervention in this patient group. Resuscitation is an aerosol-generating process and thus carries the risk of contamination. The goal of this article is to give a practice-based overview of the specialities of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in coronavirus-infected patients.",作者关键词:cardiopulmonary arrest; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; coronavirus; COVID-19,文献类型:Article,ORVOSI HETILAP,10.1556/650.2020.31816,Intrahospital resuscitation of COVID-19 patients,"作者:Istvan, L (Istvan, Laszlo)[ 1 ] ; Csilla, M (Csilla, Molnar)[ 1 ] ; Gyorgy, K (Gyorgy, Koszta)[ 1 ] ; Tamas, V (Tamas, Vegh)[ 1 ] ; Akos, F (Akos, Fabian)[ 1 ] ; Mariann, B (Mariann, Berhes)[ 1 ] ; Marianna, J (Marianna, Juhasz)[ 1 ] ; Bela, F (Bela, Fulesdi)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Nagyerdei Krt 98, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.

"摘要
The outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March, 2020. In Hungary, the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 4th March, 2020, and on 15th March, the first fatality related to the infection was announced. At the moment of the latter event, there was no central, standardized guideline, which could explain the necessary precautions, and provide an unequivocal description on how to handle the dead body. The procedure of transportation, storage, occurent autopsy or final disposition of the deceased raise a lot of questions, especially on how to carry out these tasks. Legislation related to infectious diseases and decedent management in general do not provide enough information on how to perform duties in a COVID-19 fatality case. The chief medical officer suspended the execution of autopsies, except in cases of unnatural death, since 19th March, however, the transportation and storage of fatalities can still be a problem. The Department of Pathology of the Healthcare Professional College of the Ministry of Human capacities published a procedure on recommended post-mortem duties on 21st March, but the suggested protocols only represent a narrow spectrum of international recommendations. Therefore supplementation may be necessary. Sadly, post-mortem protocols, in spite of their importance, are also underrepresented in the international literature. A further problem, wich makes adoptability difficult, is that available foreign guidelines and algorithms are optimized for different legislation, and organisations, resources not available in our country. In this article, besides providing a summary of literature, we would also like to make practical recommendations which may increase the safety of healthcare providers participating in the treatment or pathological duties with COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.",作者关键词:COVID-19; pathology; forensic pathology; autopsy,文献类型:Article,ORVOSI HETILAP,10.1556/650.2020.31818,"Role of duties related to COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed fatality cases","作者:Bence, FC (Bence, Farkas Csaba)[ 1 ] ; David, P (David, Petretei)[ 2 ] ; Gergely, B (Gergely, Babinszky)[ 3 ] ; Gabor, D (Gabor, Dudas)[ 3 ] ; Gergo, S (Gergo, Szabo)[ 4 ] ; Csaba, B (Csaba, Bognar)[ 5 ] ; Marta, J (Marta, Jackel)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Robert Karoly Krt 44, H-1134 Budapest, Hungary.

"摘要
This paper concerns study of the genome of the Wuhan Seafood Market isolate believed to represent the causative agent of the disease COVID-19. This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace. Preliminary studies using molecular modeling and docking, and in that context the potential value of certain known herbal extracts, are also described.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV coronavirus; Wuhan seafood market coronavirus; Bioinformatics; Synthetic vaccine; Peptidomimetic; Retroinverso; Q-UEL language; Automatic browser,文献类型:Article,COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,103670,"Computers and viral diseases.

"摘要
Background: The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency, but the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are not fully described. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city; and to develop a multivariate model to predict the risk of prolonged length of stay in hospital (ProLOS).

Methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Zhejiang province from January to February 20, 2020. Medical records of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into the ProLOS and non-ProLOS groups by hospital length of stay greater and less than 14 days, respectively. Conventional descriptive statistics were applied. Multivariate regression model was built to predict the risk of ProLOS, with variables selected using stepwise approach.

Results: A total of 75 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included for quantitative analysis, including 25 (33%) patients in the ProLOS group. ProLOS patients were more likely to have history of traveling to Wuhan (68% vs. 28%; P=0.002). Patients in the ProLOS group showed lower neutrophil counts [median (IQR): 2.50 (1.77-3.23) x10(9)/L vs. 2.90 (2.21-4.19) x10(9)/L; P=0.048], higher partial thrombin time (PT) (13.42 +/- 0.63 vs. 13.10 +/- 0.48 s; P=0.029), lower D-Dimer [0.26 (0.22-0.46) vs. 0.44 (0.32-0.84) mg/L; P=0.012]. There was no patient died and no severe case in our cohort. The overall LOS was 11 days (IQR, 5-15 days). The median cost for a hospital stay was 7,388.19 RMB (IQR, 5,085.39-11,145.44). The prediction model included five variables of procalcitonin, heart rate, epidemiological history, lymphocyte count and cough. The discrimination of the model was 84.8% (95% CI: 75.3% to 94.4%).

Conclusions: Our study described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city and found that the illness was less severe than that in the core epidemic region.

"摘要
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (designated as SARSCoV-2) has become a pandemic worldwide. Based on the current reports, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of sever condition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified to functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Previous experimental data revealed ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Currently doctors concern whether these commonly used renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19.

Methods: We extracted data regarding 50 hospitalized hypertension patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020. These patients were grouped into RAS blockers group (Group A, n=20) and non-RAS blockers group (Group B, n=30) according to the basic blood pressure medications. All patients continued to use pre-admission antihypertensive drugs. Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission.

Results: Ten (50%) and seventeen (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.65 +/- 13.12 and 67.77 +/- 12.84 years (P=0.000), respectively. The blood pressure of both groups was under effective control. There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P=0.03), and N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) (P=0.04) showed significant lower level in Group A than in Group B. But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups. In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NTproBNP level showed no difference between the two groups.

Conclusions: We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups. These data suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have few effects on increasing the clinical severe conditions of COVID-19.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); hypertension; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); renin-angiotensin system blockers (RAS blockers); ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs),文献类型:Article,ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,430,The effect of RAS blockers on the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hypertension,"作者:Huang, ZY (Huang, Zheyong)[ 1 ] ; Cao, JT (Cao, Jiatian)[ 1 ] ; Yao, YM (Yao, Yumeng)[ 2 ] ; Jin, XJ (Jin, Xuejuan)[ 1 ] ; Luo, Z (Luo, Zhe)[ 3 ] ; Xue, Y (Xue, Yuan)[ 3 ] ; Zhu, CW (Zhu, Chouwen)[ 4 ] ; Song, YN (Song, Yanan)[ 1 ] ; Wang, Y (Wang, Ying)[ 1 ] ; Zou, YZ (Zou, Yunzeng)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: APR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Shanghai Inst Cardiovasc Dis, 180 Feng Lin Rd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The ""novel"" coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated ""COVID-19"") is the third coronavirus outbreak emerging during the past two decades. This infectious disease, sustained by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the ""wrong virus"" at the ""wrong time""). These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination. Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken. Everybody should be inexcusably aware that this is not a drill, and that the consequences of inadequate action will be tragedy.",作者关键词:Outbreak; epidemics; coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),文献类型:Review,ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,497,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): the portrait of a perfect storm,"作者:Lippi, G (Lippi, Giuseppe)[ 1 ] ; Sanchis-Gomar, F (Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian)[ 2,3,4 ] ; Henry, BM (Henry, Brandon M.)[ 5 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Univ Hosp Verona, Sect Clin Biochem, Piazzale LA Scuro, I-37134 Verona, Italy.

"摘要
Novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) infection (COVID-19) rapidly spread across China and 25 countries in the worldwide, which infected not only adults but also children, even neonates. Each year, about 15 million newborns are delivered in China.

"摘要
It has been over 2 months since the start of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The epidemic stage of COVID-19 has brought great challenges to the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Symptoms, such as fever and cough caused by cancer, and the therapeutic process (including chemotherapy and surgery) should be differentiated from some COVID-19 related characteristics. Besides, clinical workers should not only consider the therapeutic strategy for cancer, but also emphasize COVID-19's prevention. Moreover, the detailed therapeutic regimens of CRC patients may be different from the usual. Also, treatment principles may various for CRC patients with or without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as patients with or without an emergency presentation. In this paper, we want to discuss the above-mentioned problems based on previous guidelines, the current working status and our experiences, to provide a reference for medical personnel.",作者关键词:Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19); colorectal cancer (CRC),文献类型:Review,ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,498,The challenges in colorectal cancer management during COVID-19 epidemic,"作者:Ren, XH (Ren, Xianghai)[ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ] ; Chen, BX (Chen, Baoxiang)[ 1,3,4,5,6 ] ; Hong, YT (Hong, Yuntian)[ 1,3,4,5,6 ] ; Liu, WC (Liu, Weicheng)[ 1,3,4,5,6 ] ; Jiang, Q (Jiang, Qi)[ 7 ] ; Yang, JY (Yang, Jingying)[ 8 ] ; Qian, Q (Qian, Qun)[ 1,3,4,5,6 ] ; Jiang, CQ (Jiang, Congqing)[ 1,3,4,5,6 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Project of Improving the Ability of Diagnosis and Treatment of Difficult Diseases in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (direction of neoplastic disease) ,出版年: APR 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Dept Colorectal & Anal Surg, Zhongnan Hosp, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet) for detection of COVID-19 features on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

Methods: The Ethic Committee of our institution approved the protocol of this study and waived the requirement for patient informed consent. Two hundreds and ninety-five patients were enrolled in this study (healthy person: 149; COVID-19 patients: 146), which were divided into three separate non-overlapping cohorts (training set, n=135, healthy person, n=69, patients, n=66; validation set, n=20, healthy person, n=10, patients, n=10; test set, n=140, healthy person, n=70, patients, n=70). The DenseNet was trained and tested to classify the images as having manifestation of COVID-19 or as healthy. A radiologist also blindly evaluated all the test images and rechecked the misdiagnosed cases by DenseNet. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess the model performance. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DenseNet model and radiologist were also calculated.

Results: The DenseNet algorithm model yielded an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.958-1.0) in the validation set and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.972-0.995) in the test set. The threshold value was selected as 0.8, while for validation and test sets, the accuracies were 95% and 92%, the sensitivities were 100% and 97%, the specificities were 90% and 87%, and the F1 values were 95% and 93%, respectively. The sensitivity of radiologist was 94%, the specificity was 96%, while the accuracy was 95%.

Conclusions: Deep learning (DL) with DenseNet can accurately classify COVID-19 on HRCT with an AUC of 0.98, which can reduce the miss diagnosis rate (combined with radiologists' evaluation) and radiologists' workload.",作者关键词:COVID-19; deep learning (DL); high resolution computed tomography (HRCT),文献类型:Article,ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,450,Deep learning for detecting corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on high-resolution computed tomography: a pilot study,"作者:Yang, SY (Yang, Shuyi)[ 1 ] ; Jiang, LQ (Jiang, Longquan)[ 2 ] ; Cao, ZQ (Cao, Zhuoqun)[ 2 ] ; Wang, LY (Wang, Liya)[ 3 ] ; Cao, JW (Cao, Jiawang)[ 4 ] ; Feng, R (Feng, Rui)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, ZY (Zhang, Zhiyong)[ 1,5 ] ; Xue, XY (Xue, Xiangyang)[ 2 ] ; Shi, YX (Shi, Yuxin)[ 1 ] ; Shan, F (Shan, Fei)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM),出版年: APR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Shanghai Publ Hlth Clin Ctr, Dept Radiol, 2901 Caolang Rd, Shanghai 201508, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China on December 2019 in patients presenting with atypical pneumonia. Although 'city-lockdown' policy reduced the spatial spreading of the COVID-19, the city-level outbreaks within each city remain a major concern to be addressed. The local or regional level disease control mainly depends on individuals self-administered infection prevention actions. The contradiction between choice of taking infection prevention actions or not makes the elimination difficult under a voluntary acting scheme, and represents a clash between the optimal choice of action for the individual interest and group interests.

Methods: We develop a compartmental epidemic model based on the classic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model and use this to fit the data. Behavioral imitation through a game theoretical decision-making process is incorporated to study and project the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. By varying the key model parameters, we explore the probable course of the outbreak in terms of size and timing under several public interventions in improving public awareness and sensitivity to the infection risk as well as their potential impact.

Results: We estimate the basic reproduction number, R-0, to be 2.5 (95% CI: 2.4-2.7). Under the current most realistic setting, we estimate the peak size at 0.28 (95% CI: 0.24-0.32) infections per 1,000 population. In Wuhan, the final size of the outbreak is likely to infect 1.35% (95% CI: 1.00-2.12%) of the population. The outbreak will be most likely to peak in the first half of February and drop to daily incidences lower than 10 in June 2020. Increasing sensitivity to take infection prevention actions and the effectiveness of infection prevention measures are likely to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.

Conclusions: Through an imitating social learning process, individual-level behavioral change on taking infection prevention actions have the potentials to significantly reduce the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of size and timing at city-level. Timely and substantially resources and supports for improving the willingness-to-act and conducts of self-administered infection prevention actions are recommended to reduce to the COVID-19 associated risks.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); mathematical modelling; imitation game; final epidemic size; reproduction number,文献类型:Article,ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,448,"Imitation dynamics in the mitigation of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China from 2019 to 2020","作者:Zhao, S (Zhao, Shi)[ 1,2 ] ; Stone, L (Stone, Lewi)[ 3,4 ] ; Gao, DZ (Gao, Daozhou)[ 5 ] ; Musa, SS (Musa, Salihu S.)[ 6 ] ; Chong, MKC (Chong, Marc K.

A 35-year-old woman presented with fever and mild diarrhoea without any respiratory symptoms 9 days after travelling to Japan from Wuhan, China. Her computed tomography scan revealed pneumonia. The first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on throat swab for the novel corona virus upon admission was negative. Therefore, she was treated for community-acquired pneumonia, but fever persisted. On hospital day 5, PCR test on induced sputum was positive, but a second polymerase chain reaction test on throat swab remained negative. She was discharged, fully recovered, on hospital day 12. A lower respiratory tract specimen should be obtained for better diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms for patients with significant travel or exposure history.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2); real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay,文献类型:Article,INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1080/23744235.2020.1744711,A case of imported COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR-positive lower respiratory specimen but with PCR-negative throat swabs,"作者:Hase, R (Hase, Ryota)[ 1,2 ] ; Kurita, T (Kurita, Takashi)[ 1 ] ; Muranaka, E (Muranaka, Emiri)[ 1,2 ] ; Sasazawa, H (Sasazawa, Hiroki)[ 1,2 ] ; Mito, H (Mito, Haruki)[ 1 ] ; Yano, Y (Yano, Yudai)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,出版年: JUN 2 2020,"90-1 Iidacho, Chiba, Japan.

"摘要
The recent outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gripped the world with apprehension and has evoked a scare of epic proportion regarding its potential to spread and infect humans worldwide. As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host-virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the need for a model for staging COVID-19 based on neurological tissue involvement.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; ACE2 tissue distribution; host-virus interaction; spike protein,文献类型:Editorial Material,ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE,10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00122,"Evidence of the COVID-19 Virus Targeting the CNS: Tissue Distribution, Host-Virus Interaction, and Proposed Neurotropic Mechanisms","作者:Baig, AM (Baig, Abdul Mannan)[ 1 ] ; Khaleeq, A (Khaleeq, Areeba)[ 1 ] ; Ali, U (Ali, Usman)[ 2 ] ; Syeda, H (Syeda, Hira)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Neurosciences & Neurology,Aga Khan University ,出版年: APR 1 2020,"Aga Khan Univ, Dept Biol & Biomed Sci, Karachi 74800, Pakistan.

We aimed to investigate the chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Materials and methods: Chest HRCT images of 12 patients who were diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia in our institute from January 28, 2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The most typical HRCT findings were bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities, with or without consolidation in the lung periphery, and sometimes also showed a rounded morphology. Three (25%) patients had typical crazy paving signs, 3 (25%) patients showed air bronchogram, 2 (16.67%) patients with bronchial wall thickening signs, and 5 (41.67%) patients had vascular perforator signs. Only one (8.33%) patient had unilateral involvement in the left upper lobe. Lung cavitation, pleural effusions and intrathoracic lymph node enlargement were not found in all patients. The severity of the lesions in the right lung, and in the lower lobe were worsen than those in the left lung and upper lobe, respectively. Lesions in the lateroposterior zone of the lung were more common than those in the apical and central areas. Notably, 9 (75%) patients with chest HRCT findings related to COVID-19 pneumonia had negative results of concurrent nucleic acid tests. Conclusions: Chest HRCT can provide an important basis for early clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and help subsequent intervention for the patients to stop further transmission, especially consider that the mild clinical symptoms and the initial negative results of nucleic acid tests of these patients are common.",作者关键词:COVID-19 pneumonia; chest CT; tomography; X-ray computed,文献类型:Article,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH,10.18869/acadpub.ijrr.18.2.343,Chest high-resolution computed tomography imaging findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia,"作者:He, X (He, X.)[ 1 ] ; Zheng, J (Zheng, J.)[ 1 ] ; Ren, JL (Ren, J.

"摘要
The coronavirus pandemic is a major challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. For urology, the expansion of the health-care structures for the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19 should be supported as best as possible. At the same time, one should aim to ensure adequate care for urological emergencies and urgent urological treatments as far as possible, even during the pandemic. For this, patients must be prioritized individually, alternative therapy concepts must be considered and regional and supraregional cooperation must be used. Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment. Urological clinics must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on SARS-CoV-2 patients should be considered. Furthermore strictly defined hygiene measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Prioritization; Patient care; Reallocation; Urgent surgery,文献类型:Article,UROLOGE,10.1007/s00120-020-01200-1,Urology in the corona-virus pandemic-a guideline 4/20,"作者:Kriegmair, MC (Kriegmair, M.

"摘要
These recommendations are mainly based on an expert consensus on special features, patient-specific advantages and possible resource conservation in view of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These recommendations may change if new clinical data are published or new aspects of the pandemic situation are added.

In the current situation, elective interventions have been largely postponed and there are mostly only urgent and emergency surgical interventions per-formed in Germany. By delaying elective procedures, the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for patients is reduced, human resources and material resources are spared in view of the increasing pandemic situation. The use of regional anesthesia techniques instead of general anesthesia presumably avoids aerosol formation in COVID-19-positive patients (employee protection) and reduces possible patient risks due to the special features of general anesthesia in COVID-19 patients (restricted sensory function of the practitioner by the Personal protective equipment (PPE), mandatory rapid sequence induction, etc.).

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. Novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected NCIP.

"摘要
A coronavirus (HCoV-19) has caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China. Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b(mid) regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-alpha was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2 - and TMPRSS2 - which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.",作者关键词:COVID-19; ACE2 negative; mesenchymal stem cells; cell transplantation; immunomodulation; function recovery,文献类型:Article,AGING AND DISEASE,10.14336/AD.2020.0228,Transplantation of ACE2(-) Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves the Outcome of Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"作者:Leng, ZK (Leng, Zikuan)[ 1,5 ] ; Zhu, RJ (Zhu, Rongjia)[ 2 ] ; Hou, W (Hou, Wei)[ 3 ] ; Feng, YM (Feng, Yingmei)[ 3 ] ; Yang, YL (Yang, Yanlei)[ 4 ] ; Han, Q (Han, Qin)[ 2 ] ; Shan, GL (Shan, Guangliang)[ 2 ] ; Meng, FY (Meng, Fanyan)[ 1 ] ; Du, DS (Du, Dongshu)[ 1 ] ; Wang, SH (Wang, Shihua)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Geriatrics & Gerontology,National Key Research and Development Program of China ,出版年: APR 2020,"Shanghai Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

"摘要
A new study published by the journal Aging & Disease reported that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes (Leng et al., Aging Dis, 11:216-228, 2020). This study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, treating COVID-19 patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking.

"摘要
There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.",作者关键词:2019-nCOV; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Pneumonia; Review,文献类型:Review,INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6,A Review of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19),"作者:Singhal, T (Singhal, Tanu)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,,出版年: APR 2020,"Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hosp & Med Res Inst, Dept Pediat & Infect Dis, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

"摘要
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), has affected the lives of 71,429 people globally. Originating in China, the disease has a rapid progression to other countries. Research suggests remarkable genomic resemblance of 2019-nCoV with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which has a history of a pandemic in 2002. With evidence of nosocomial spread, a number of diligent measures are being employed to constrain its propagation.

"摘要
The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.",,文献类型:Article,NATURE MICROBIOLOGY,10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z,The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2,"作者:Gorbalenya, AE (Gorbalenya, Alexander E.)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Baker, SC (Baker, Susan C.)[ 5 ] ; Baric, RS (Baric, Ralph S.)[ 6 ] ; de Groot, RJ (de Groot, Raoul J.)[ 7 ] ; Drosten, C (Drosten, Christian)[ 8 ] ; Gulyaeva, AA (Gulyaeva, Anastasia A.)[ 2 ] ; Haagmans, BL (Haagmans, Bart L.)[ 9 ] ; Lauber, C (Lauber, Chris)[ 2 ] ; Leontovich, AM (Leontovich, Andrey M.)[ 3,4 ] ; Neuman, BW (Neuman, Benjamin W.)[ 10 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Microbiology,EU Horizon 2020 ,出版年: APR 2020,"Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Data Sci, Leiden, Netherlands.

"摘要
The coronavirus (COVID-19) has challenged health professions and systems and has evoked different speeds of reaction and types of response around the world. The role of dental professionals in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 is critically important. While all routine dental care has been suspended in countries experiencing COVID-19 disease during the period of pandemic, the need for organised urgent care delivered by teams provided with appropriate personal protective equipment takes priority. Dental professionals can also contribute to medical care. Major and rapid reorganisation of both clinical and support services is not straightforward. Dental professionals felt a moral duty to reduce routine care for fear of spreading COVID-19 among their patients and beyond, but were understandably concerned about the financial consequences. Amidst the explosion of information available online and through social media, it is difficult to identify reliable research evidence and guidance, but moral decisions must be made.",,文献类型:Article,BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL,10.1038/s41415-020-1482-1,Dentistry and coronavirus (COVID-19)-moral decision-making,"作者:Coulthard, P (Coulthard, Paul)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",,出版年: APR 2020,"Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Turner St, London E1 2AD, England.

Aim To subjectively and objectively evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of a low-dose, long-pitch dual-source chest CT protocol on third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) with spectral shaping at 100Sn kVp for COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. Results The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma. Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (p = 0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT. Conclusions Ultra-low-dose, dual-source, fast CT protocol provides highly diagnostic images for COVID-19 with potential for reduction in dose and motion artifacts.",作者关键词:COVID-19; 2019-nCOV; Dual-source CT; Spectral shaping; Low-dose CT; Chest radiology,文献类型:Article,RADIOLOGIA MEDICA,10.1007/s11547-020-01179-x,"Proposal of a low-dose, long-pitch, dual-source chest CT protocol on third-generation dual-source CT using a tin filter for spectral shaping at 100 kVp for CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: a feasibility study","作者:Agostini, A (Agostini, Andrea)[ 1,2 ] ; Floridi, C (Floridi, Chiara)[ 1,2 ] ; Borgheresi, A (Borgheresi, Alessandra)[ 2 ] ; Badaloni, M (Badaloni, Myriam)[ 2 ] ; Pirani, PE (Pirani, Paolo Esposto)[ 2 ] ; Terilli, F (Terilli, Filippo)[ 2 ] ; Ottaviani, L (Ottaviani, Letizia)[ 2 ] ; Giovagnoni, A (Giovagnoni, Andrea)[ 1,2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: APR 2020,"Univ Hosp Umberto I Lancisi Salesi, Dept Radiol, Div Special & Pediat Radiol, Via Conca 71, I-60126 Ancona, AN, Italy.

"摘要
Background: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932 166 cases with 46 764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency.

Methods: Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19.

Results: Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions.

Conclusion: COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly. Iran has made many efforts to defeat the outbreak, but more coherent, timely and efficient action is required, now, more than ever, to save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Health Policy; Iran; Learning; Pandemic,文献类型:Article,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.02,COVID-19 Pandemic and Comparative Health Policy Learning in Iran,"作者:Raoofi, A (Raoofi, Azam)[ 1 ] ; Takian, A (Takian, Amirhossein)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Sari, AA (Sari, Ali Akbari)[ 1 ] ; Olyaeemanesh, A (Olyaeemanesh, Alireza)[ 3,4 ] ; Haghighi, H (Haghighi, Hajar)[ 1 ] ; Aarabi, M (Aarabi, Mohsen)[ 5,6 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Publ Policy, Poursina Ave,Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran, Iran.

Background: Coronavirus, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), is rapidly spreading around the world. Since the number of corona positive patients is increasing sharply in Iran, this study aimed to forecast the number of newly infected patients in the coming days in Iran.

Methods: The data used in this study were obtained from daily reports of the Iranian Ministry of Health and the datasets provided by the Johns Hopkins University including the number of new infected cases from February 19, 2020 to March 21, 2020. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to predict the number of patients during the next thirty days.

Results: The ARIMA model forecasted an exponential increase in the number of newly detected patients. The result of this study also show that if the spreading pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 3574 by April 20.

Conclusion: Since this disease is highly contagious, health politicians need to make decisions to prevent its spread; otherwise, even the most advanced and capable health care systems would face problems for treating all infected patients and a substantial number of deaths will become inevitable.",作者关键词:COVID19; Forecast; Iran,文献类型:Article,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.03,The Exponentially Increasing Rate of Patients Infected with COVID-19 in Iran,"作者:Moftakhar, L (Moftakhar, Leila)[ 1 ] ; Seif, M (Seif, Mozhgan)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Shiraz, Iran.

Background: In late December 2019, a viral pneumonia known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated from China and spread very rapidly in the world. Since then, COVID-19 has become a global concern and health problem.

Methods: We present four patients in this study, selected from among patients who presented with pneumonia symptoms and were suspicious for COVID-19. They were referred to the intended centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran. Two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal throat swab samples were collected from each patient and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). The samples were also tested for influenza viruses and the complete respiratory panel.

Results: In the present report, four patients were diagnosed in the starting days of COVID-19 disease in our center in southern Iran with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.

Conclusion: This co-infection of COVID-19 and influenza A highlights the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay regardless of other positive findings for other pathogens in the primary test during the epidemic.",作者关键词:Coinfection; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; Influenza; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,文献类型:Article,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.04,Co-infection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Influenza A: A Report from Iran,"作者:Khodamoradi, Z (Khodamoradi, Zohre)[ 1,2 ] ; Moghadami, M (Moghadami, Mohsen)[ 3 ] ; Lotfi, M (Lotfi, Mehrzad)[ 4 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Hlth Policy Res Ctr, Inst Hlth, Shiraz, Iran.

Background: The rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020.

Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package.

Results: Based on our predictions of Iran about 29 000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases.

Conclusion: The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.",作者关键词:China; COVID-19; Iran; Prediction,文献类型:Article,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.05,A Model for COVID-19 Prediction in Iran Based on China Parameters,"作者:Zareie, B (Zareie, Bushra)[ 1,2 ] ; Roshani, A (Roshani, Amin)[ 3 ] ; Mansournia, MA (Mansournia, Mohammad Ali)[ 4 ] ; Rasouli, MA (Rasouli, Mohammad Aziz)[ 2,5 ] ; Moradi, G (Moradi, Ghobad)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,"Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran ",出版年: APR 2020,"Kurdistan Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Pasdaran Ave, Sanandaj, Iran.

Background: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began its journey around the world. Medical students, as frontline healthcare workers, are more susceptible to be infected by the virus. The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 related knowledge, self-reported preventive behaviors and risk perception among Iranian medical students within the first week after the onset of the outbreak in Iran.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 26th to 28th of February, 2020. Participants were Iranian medical students (5th-7th year) whose knowledge, preventive behaviors and risk perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 26 questions including 15 items about COVID-19 related knowledge, 9 items regarding preventive measures and 2 items about COVID-19 risk perception. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were shown to be satisfactory.

Results: A total of 240 medical students completed the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 23.67 years. The average of correct answers of knowledge was 86.96%; and 79.60% had high level of related knowledge. The average rate of practicing preventive behaviors was 94.47%; and 94.2% had high level of performance in preventive behaviors. The cumulative score of risk perception was 4.08 out of 8 which was in moderate range. Risk perception was significantly different between stagers and interns and between those being trained in emergency room (ER) and non-ER wards. There was a significant negative correlation between preventive behaviors and risk perception.

Conclusion: We found a high level of COVID-19 related knowledge and self-reported preventive behaviors and moderate risk perception among Iranian medical students.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Health behavior; Knowledge; Medical students; Prevention and control; Risk,文献类型:Article,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.06,"COVID-19 and Iranian Medical Students; A Survey on Their Related-Knowledge, Preventive Behaviors and Risk Perception","作者:Taghrir, MH (Taghrir, Mohammad Hossein)[ 1 ] ; Borazjani, R (Borazjani, Roham)[ 1 ] ; Shiraly, R (Shiraly, Ramin)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Student Res Comm, Shiraz, Iran.

"摘要
On March 11th 2020, the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the WHO. One of the groups that is considered high risk in this pandemic are cancer patients as they are treated with a variety of immune system suppressor treatment modalities and this puts them in a great risk for infectious disease (including COVID-19). Therefore, cancer patients require higher level measures for preventing and treating infectious diseases. furthermore, cancer patients may bear additional risk due to the restriction of access to the routine diagnostic and therapeutic services during such epidemic. Since most of the attention of health systems is towards patients affected with COVID-19, the need for structured and unified approaches to COVID-19 prevention and care specific to cancer patients and cancer centers is felt more than ever. This article provides the recommendations and possible actions that should be considered by patients, their caregivers and families, physician, nurses, managers and staff of medical centers involved in cancer diagnosis and treatment. We pursued two major goals in our recommendations: first, limiting the exposure of cancer patients to medical environments and second, modifying the treatment modalities in a manner that reduces the probability of myelosuppression such as delaying elective diagnostic and therapeutic services, shortening the treatment course, or prolonging the interval between treatment courses.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Cancer; Pandemic,文献类型:Article,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.07,COVID19 Prevention & Care; A Cancer Specific Guideline,"作者:Motlagh, A (Motlagh, Ali)[ 1,2 ] ; Yamrali, M (Yamrali, Maisa)[ 3 ] ; Azghandi, S (Azghandi, Samira)[ 4 ] ; Azadeh, P (Azadeh, Payam)[ 2 ] ; Vaezi, M (Vaezi, Mohammad)[ 4 ] ; Ashrafi, F (Ashrafi, Farzaneh)[ 5 ] ; Zendehdel, K (Zendehdel, Kazem)[ 6 ] ; Mirzaei, H (Mirzaei, Hamidreza)[ 2 ] ; Basi, A (Basi, Ali)[ 7 ] ; Rakhsha, A (Rakhsha, Afshin)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Iran Univ Med Sci, Dept Radiat Oncol, Tehran, Iran.

"摘要
On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government announced the city lockdown of Wuhan. Since then, there have been controversial debates among experts about the efficacy of mass quarantine, the oldest and probably one of the most effective methods for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. The impact of health policymaking section of health system governance becomes visible to all stakeholders and the public in such emergency contexts. The success and failure of such policies should be evaluated in order to find the proper course of action for the local and international communities. In this review, we aim to investigate the efficacy of mass quarantine in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We found good quality evidence for the effectiveness of mass quarantine during the current stage of COVID-19 pandemic, and these strategies seem to have been highly effective in controlling the spread of the disease.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Disease outbreaks; Health Policy; Pandemics; Quarantine; Viruses,文献类型:Review,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.08,Efficacy of Mass Quarantine as Leverage of Health System Governance During COVID-19 Outbreak: A Mini Policy Review,"作者:Taghrir, MH (Taghrir, Mohammad Hossein)[ 1 ] ; Akbarialiabad, H (Akbarialiabad, Hossein)[ 1 ] ; Marzaleh, MA (Marzaleh, Milad Ahmadi)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Student Res Comm, Shiraz, Iran.

"摘要
Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Wuhan, China. Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus. The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast. Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy. In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care. Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19.",作者关键词:COVID-19 virus; Epidemiology; Review,文献类型:Review,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.09,Epidemiology and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19,"作者:Huang, XY (Huang, Xiaoyi)[ 1 ] ; Wei, FX (Wei, Fengxiang)[ 2 ] ; Hu, L (Hu, Liang)[ 2 ] ; Wen, LJ (Wen, Lijuan)[ 2 ] ; Chen, K (Chen, Ken)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,Longgang Science and Technology Development Foundation ,出版年: APR 2020,"Guangdong Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Nursing, 283 Jianghai Ave, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which has subsequently affected more than 200 countries worldwide including Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa and other places. The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing.

Objective: To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China. To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19.

Methods: Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020. Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed. The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results.

Results: Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 +/- 11.32, 5 males). No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P > 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P < 0.05). Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc.

Conclusion: The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas. Etiological testing should be performed as early as possible for clinically suspected patients.",作者关键词:Clinical characteristics; Computed tomographic; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic,文献类型:Article,ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE,10.34172/aim.2020.10,Improved Early Recognition of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19): Single-Center Data from a Shanghai Screening Hospital,"作者:Peng, L (Peng, Ling)[ 1,2 ] ; Liu, KY (Liu, Kang-Yong)[ 3 ] ; Xue, F (Xue, Fei)[ 2 ] ; Miao, YF (Miao, Ya-Fang)[ 2 ] ; Tu, PA (Tu, Ping-An)[ 4 ] ; Zhou, C (Zhou, Chao)[ 2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,"Key Discipline of Pudong New Area, Shanghai ",出版年: APR 2020,"1500 Zhouyuan Rd, Shanghai 201318, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda.",作者关键词:Supply chain; Risk management; Resilience; Epidemic outbreak; Coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemic plan; Simulation; Digital twin,文献类型:Article,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW,UNSP 101922,Predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains: A simulation-based analysis on the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) case,"作者:Ivanov, D (Ivanov, Dmitry)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Transportation,,出版年: APR 2020,"Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, Supply Chain & Operat Management, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.

"摘要
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a dramatic loss of lives worldwide, challenging the sustainability of our health care systems, threatening economic meltdown, and putting pressure on the mental health of individuals (due to social distancing and lock-down measures). The pandemic is also posing severe challenges to the scientific community, with scholars under pressure to respond to policymakers' demands for advice despite the absence of adequate, trusted data. Understanding the pandemic requires fine-grained data representing specific local conditions and the social reactions of individuals. While experts have built simulation models to estimate disease trajectories that may be enough to guide decision-makers to formulate policy measures to limit the epidemic, they do not cover the full behavioural and social complexity of societies under pandemic crisis. Modelling that has such a large potential impact upon people's lives is a great responsibility. This paper calls on the scientific community to improve the transparency, access, and rigour of their models. It also calls on stakeholders to improve the rapidity with which data from trusted sources are released to the community (in a fully responsible manner). Responding to the pandemic is a stress test of our collaborative capacity and the social/economic value of research.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Pandemic Disease; Agent-Based Models; Modelling; Policy; Data,文献类型:Article,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,10,Computational Models that Matter During a Global Pandemic Outbreak: A Call to Action,"作者:Squazzoni, F (Squazzoni, Flaminio)[ 1 ] ; Polhill, JG (Polhill, J.

"摘要
Objective: This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in Korea.

Materials and Methods: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions.

Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006).

Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Pneumonia; COVID-19; Chest X-ray; Computed tomography,文献类型:Article,KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.3348/kjr.2020.0132,Chest Radiographic and CT Findings of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Analysis of Nine Patients Treated in Korea,"作者:Yoon, SH (Yoon, Soon Ho)[ 1 ] ; Lee, KH (Lee, Kyung Hee)[ 2 ] ; Kim, JY (Kim, Jin Yong)[ 3 ] ; Lee, YK (Lee, Young Kyung)[ 4 ] ; Ko, H (Ko, Hongseok)[ 5 ] ; Kim, KH (Kim, Ki Hwan)[ 6 ] ; Park, CM (Park, Chang Min)[ 1 ] ; Kim, YH (Kim, Yun Hyeon)[ 7 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology ,出版年: APR 2020,"Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Radiol, Coll Med, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea.

"摘要
The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still gradually spreading worldwide. The nucleic acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of infection, yet several recent studies have reported false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Here, we report two representative false-negative cases and discuss the supplementary role of clinical data with rRT-PCR, including laboratory examination results and computed tomography features. Coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and other viruses has been discussed as well.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-COV-2; rRT-PCR; False-negative results; Laboratory examination; Computed tomography,文献类型:Article,KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.3348/kjr.2020.0146,False-Negative Results of Real-Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: Role of Deep-Learning-Based CT Diagnosis and Insights from Two Cases,"作者:Li, DS (Li, Dasheng)[ 1 ] ; Wang, DW (Wang, Dawei)[ 3 ] ; Dong, JP (Dong, Jianping)[ 2 ] ; Wang, NN (Wang, Nana)[ 1 ] ; Huang, H (Huang, He)[ 1 ] ; Xu, HW (Xu, Haiwang)[ 1 ] ; Xia, C (Xia, Chen)[ 3 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: APR 2020,"Peking Univ, Beijing Haidian Hosp, Hosp 3, Beijing Haidian Sect,Dept Radiol, 29 Zhongguancun Rd, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In December 2019 a new human coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, which is known as SARS-CoV-2. The clinical course of the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung failure. The virus is currently rapidly spreading around the world and pushing health systems to the limits of their capacity due to the exponential increase in the number of cases. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 lies in the bat coronavirus pool and has now emerged in the human population due to interspecies transmission. Molecular diagnostic methods have been established in a very short time and a number of clinical studies on the effectiveness of different antiviral drugs are ongoing. The development of a vaccine using different approaches is also under investigation. Considering the high number of cases and mortality rates of up to 9% there is an urgent need for action. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on human coronaviruses with a strong focus on the current data on SARS-CoV-2. Due to the daily changing level of knowledge, the article reflects the status up to 21 March 2020.",作者关键词:SARS-Coronavirus-2; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Antiviral drugs; Viral vaccines,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MONATSSCHRIFT KINDERHEILKUNDE,10.1007/s00112-020-00910-2,Coronavirus: from common cold to severe pulmonary failure Chronology of a pandemia,"作者:Hufert, F (Hufert, F.)[ 1 ] ; Spiegel, M (Spiegel, M.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,,APR 2020,"Med Hsch Brandenburg Fontane, Inst Mikrobiol & Virol, BTU Campus Senftenberg,Univ Pl 1, D-01968 Senftenberg, Germany.

"摘要
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is highly contagious. Airway management of patients with COVID-19 is high risk to staff and patients. We aimed to develop principles for airway management of patients with COVID-19 to encourage safe, accurate and swift performance. This consensus statement has been brought together at short notice to advise on airway management for patients with COVID-19, drawing on published literature and immediately available information from clinicians and experts. Recommendations on the prevention of contamination of healthcare workers, the choice of staff involved in airway management, the training required and the selection of equipment are discussed. The fundamental principles of airway management in these settings are described for: emergency tracheal intubation; predicted or unexpected difficult tracheal intubation; cardiac arrest; anaesthetic care; and tracheal extubation. We provide figures to support clinicians in safe airway management of patients with COVID-19. The advice in this document is designed to be adapted in line with local workplace policies.",作者关键词:airway; anaesthesia; coronavirus; COVID-19; critical care; difficult airway; intubation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15054,"Consensus guidelines for managing the airway in patients with COVID-19 Guidelines from the Difficult Airway Society, the Association of Anaesthetists the Intensive Care Society, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and the Royal College of Anaesthetists","作者:Cook, TM (Cook, T.

"摘要
The use of electret N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95FFRs) after prolonged storage or treatment can reduce the expense of buying non-expired N95 and thus enable developing and developed countries to optimize their use of limited resources to against airborne particles and diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The filtration performance of five N95FFR models following long-term storage, removal of charge using isopropanol alcohol (IPA), autoclaving, or treatment with gamma-radiation was assessed using a TSI 8130 automated filter tester. Statistically significant differences were found in the penetration (P), pressure drop (Delta p) and quality factor (q(f)) between non-expired and expired N95 models 3M-8210 and 3M-8511. A statistically significant linear correlation was also obtained between the N95 penetration ratio (PR) and the difference between year of manufacture and time of test (DYM). The PR of N95 was more strongly influenced by eliminating the charge (for extremely out-of-date respirators) on the electret filter than by the DYM. Sterilization by gamma irradiation increased the P into non-expired and expired N95FFR models (p < 0.05), reducing their q(f). The q(f) of all N95FFR models, except UVEX-3200, was strongly affected by gamma irradiation, the removal of charge using IPA, autoclaving, and storage in that order.

"摘要
Background: Since early December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) infection has been prevalent in China and eventually spread to other countries. There are a few published cases of COVID-19 occurring during pregnancy and due the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, there is a concern that the fetuses may be at risk of congenital COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. Results: A total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported. No COVID-19 infection was detected in their neonates or placentas. Two mothers died from COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. Conclusions: Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Mothers may be at increased risk for more severe respiratory complications.",作者关键词:Corona Virus; COVID-19; vertical transmission; placenta; pregnant mothers; neonate,文献类型:Review; Early Access,FETAL AND PEDIATRIC PATHOLOGY,10.1080/15513815.2020.1747120,Vertical Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) from Infected Pregnant Mothers to Neonates: A Review,"作者:Karimi-Zarchi, M (Karimi-Zarchi, Mojgan)[ 1,2 ] ; Neamatzadeh, H (Neamatzadeh, Hossein)[ 3,4 ] ; Dastgheib, SA (Dastgheib, Seyed Alireza)[ 5 ] ; Abbasi, H (Abbasi, Hajar)[ 6 ] ; Mirjalili, SR (Mirjalili, Seyed Reza)[ 4,7 ] ; Behforouz, A (Behforouz, Athena)[ 6 ] ; Ferdosian, F (Ferdosian, Farzad)[ 7,8 ] ; Bahrami, R (Bahrami, Reza)[ 9 ]",研究方向:Pathology; Pediatrics,,APR 2020,"Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Med Genet, Shiraz, Iran.

"摘要
An unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China emerged in December 2019. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is caused by a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 90,870 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths worldwide. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the current state of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.",作者关键词:Novel coronavirus; Wuhan; Viral transmission; Global health emergency; COVID-19,文献类型:Review,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.02.034,World Health Organization declares global emergency: A review of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19),"作者:Sohrabi, C (Sohrabi, Catrin)[ 1 ] ; Alsafi, Z (Alsafi, Zaid)[ 2 ] ; O'Neill, N (O'Neill, Niamh)[ 1 ] ; Khan, M (Khan, Mehdi)[ 2 ] ; Kerwan, A (Kerwan, Ahmed)[ 3 ] ; Al-Jabir, A (Al-Jabir, Ahmed)[ 3 ] ; Iosifidis, C (Iosifidis, Christos)[ 1 ] ; Agha, R (Agha, Riaz)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Surgery,,出版年: APR 2020,"Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England.

"摘要
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.",作者关键词:clinical features; cognition; COVID-19; northeast Chongqing; treatment,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25783,Clinical features and treatment of COVID-19 patients in northeast Chongqing,"作者:Wan, SX (Wan, Suxin)[ 1 ] ; Xiang, Y (Xiang, Yi)[ 1,2 ] ; Fang, W (Fang, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Zheng, Y (Zheng, Yu)[ 3 ] ; Li, BQ (Li, Boqun)[ 1 ] ; Hu, YJ (Hu, Yanjun)[ 1 ] ; Lang, CH (Lang, Chunhui)[ 1,4 ] ; Huang, DQ (Huang, Daoqiu)[ 1 ] ; Sun, QY (Sun, Qiuyan)[ 1 ] ; Xiong, Y (Xiong, Yan)[ 1,5 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,APR 2020,"Chongqing Univ Three Gorges Hosp, Chongqing Three Gorges Cent Hosp, Pharmaceut Dept, Chongqing 404100, Peoples R China.

Objectives To describe the first isolation and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia and rapid sharing of the isolate.

Setting SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a 58-year-old man from Wuhan, China who arrived in Melbourne on 19 January 2020 and was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne from the emergency department on 24 January 2020 with fever, cough, and progressive dyspnoea.

Major outcomes Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient.

Results A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections.

"摘要
This century is witnessing dramatic changes in the health needs of the world's populations. The double burden of infectious and chronic diseases constitutes major causes of morbidity and mortality. Over the last two decades, there has been a rise in infectious diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), the H1N1 pandemic influenza, the Ebolavirus and the Covid-19 virus. These diseases have rapidly spread across the world and have reminded us of the unprecedented connectivity that defines our modern civilization. Though some countries have made substantial progress toward improving global surveillance for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), the vast majority of Low-and Middle-income Countries (LMICs) with fragile health systems and various system-related bottlenecks remain vulnerable to outbreaks and, as such, experience dramatic social and economic consequences when they are reported. Lessons learned from past outbreaks suggest that gender inequalities are common across a range of health issues relating to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), with women being particularly disadvantaged, partially due to the burden placed on them. Though these countries are striving to improve their health systems and be more inclusive to this vulnerable group, the national/ global outbreaks have burdened the overall system and thus paralyzed normal services dedicated to the delivery of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services. In this paper, we discuss the global commitments to SRH, the impact of the EIDs on the LMICs, the failure in the delivery of SRH services, and the strategies for successful implementation of recovery plans that must address the specific and differentiated needs of women and girls in resource-poor settings.",作者关键词:Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHRs); Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs); Low; and middle-income countries (LMICs); Sustainable developmental goals (SDGs); Gender; Women; Covid-19; Ebola; Zika; SARS,文献类型:Editorial Material,REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH,43,Emerging infectious diseases and outbreaks: implications for women's reproductive health and rights in resource-poor settings,"作者:Chattu, VK (Chattu, Vijay Kumar)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Yaya, S (Yaya, Sanni)[ 4,5 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,出版年: APR 1 2020,"Univ Ottawa, Fac Social Sci, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

"摘要
Satisfactory outcome was observed in one mild case and one severe case of COVID-19 pneumonia after the use of the online/offline multidisciplinary quarantine observation form, online monitoring, and classified diagnosis and treatment, as well as strict compliance with quarantine measures. Conditions of both patients were improved, and cross-infection and disease onset clustering were not observed. The multidisciplinary self-quarantine model provides early judgment, identification, and treatment of disease, improves compliance with early rehabilitation, increases confidence in recovery, and enhances self-management capabilities. This model is applicable to the current novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic and can actively promote the management of suspected or confirmed mild cases, monitoring of critical cases, and self-management of discharged patients. The application of this new management model is worthy of being promoted in our specialized treatment facilities and in countries with severe epidemics.",作者关键词:novel coronavirus pneumonia; quarantine; multidisciplinary collaboration; self-management; online management; telemedicine; e-Health,文献类型:Article; Early Access,TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,10.1089/tmj.2020.0066,Implications for Online Management: Two Cases with COVID-19,"作者:Huang, SF (Huang, Sufang)[ 1 ] ; Xiao, YR (Xiao, Yaru)[ 1 ] ; Yan, L (Yan, Li)[ 1 ] ; Deng, J (Deng, Juan)[ 1 ] ; He, M (He, Mei)[ 1 ] ; Lu, J (Lu, Jun)[ 1 ] ; Ke, S (Ke, Shun)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,Huazhong University of Science and Technology ,APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, 1095 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Human beings have experienced a serious public health event as the new pneumonia (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has killed more than 3000 people in China, most of them elderly or people with underlying chronic diseases or immunosuppressed states. Rapid assessment and early warning are essential for outbreak analysis in response to serious public health events. This paper reviews the current model analysis methods and conclusions from both micro and macro perspectives. The establishment of a comprehensive assessment model, and the use of model analysis prediction, is very efficient for the early warning of infectious diseases. This would significantly improve global surveillance capacity, particularly in developing regions, and improve basic training in infectious diseases and molecular epidemiology.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Models; Rapid assessment; Early warning,文献类型:Review; Early Access,VIROLOGICA SINICA,10.1007/s12250-020-00219-0,The Rapid Assessment and Early Warning Models for COVID-19,"作者:Bai, ZH (Bai, Zhihua)[ 1,2 ] ; Gong, Y (Gong, Yue)[ 3 ] ; Tian, XD (Tian, Xiaodong)[ 1 ] ; Cao, Y (Cao, Ying)[ 1 ] ; Liu, WJ (Liu, Wenjun)[ 1,2,4 ] ; Li, J (Li, Jing)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,National Science and Technology Major Project ,APR 2020,"Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Pathogen Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Microbiol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.

Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done <= 1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.

Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49.5 years (SD 11.0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10.5 (SD 6.4) overall, 2.8 (3.3) in group 1, 11.1 (5.4) in group 2,13.0 (5.7) in group 3, and 12.1 (5.9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4).

Interpretation COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from China infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) were reviewed, with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings. Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent. Follow-up imaging in a subset of patients during the study time window often demonstrated mild or moderate progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities.

"摘要
Background: The chest CT findings of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously beendescribed in detail.

Purpose: To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans.

Materials and Methods: Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women; age range 16-76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.

Results: Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocytecount. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients,and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement,while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer ( 431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P,.001). Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P,.001). Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.

Conclusion: Patients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posteri or lungson CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.

"摘要
A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of China and multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287 cases have been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases have also been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest data, a total of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality reaching approximately 2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs for the human coronavirus. Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of the virus and its clinical characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Thus, the present study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not much but timely reports on the 2019-nCoV. (C) 2020 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"摘要
Background: Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020.

Findings: A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later.

Interpretation: Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multi-focal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19. (C) 2020 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose: To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.

Results: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 degrees C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis.

Conclusion: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP. (C) 2020 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"摘要
Background: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.

Methods: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.

Findings: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.

Interpretation: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

"摘要
Background Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.

Methods We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R-0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.

Findings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R-0 of 1.5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R-0 was 2.5 or 3.5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R-0 of 1.5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R-0 of 2.5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R-0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R-0 was 1.5. For R-0 values of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.

Interpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

Background There is little published evidence on the gastrointestinal features of COVID-19.

Aims To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission.

Methods We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak.

Results With an incidence of 3% (1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)-50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)-49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)-66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)-29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)-6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)-13.7% (10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 +/- 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6% (5/138)-15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)-66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. In 36% (5/14)-53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)-82% (54/66) patients for 1-11 days.

Conclusions Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China. SARS-CoV-2 enters gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and the faeces of COVID-19 patients are potentially infectious.",,文献类型:Review,ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS,10.1111/apt.15731,Review article: gastrointestinal features in COVID-19 and the possibility of faecal transmission,"作者:Tian, Y (Tian, Yuan)[ 1 ] ; Rong, L (Rong, Long)[ 1 ] ; Nian, WD (Nian, Weidong)[ 1 ] ; He, Y (He, Yan)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,出版年: MAY 2020,"Peking Univ, Dept Endoscopy Ctr, Hosp 1, 8 Xishiku St, Beijing 100034, Peoples R China.

The World Health Organization has recently defined the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection a pandemic. The infection, that may cause a potentially very severe respiratory disease, now called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has airborne transmission via droplets. The rate of transmission is quite high, higher than common influenza. Healthcare workers are at high risk of contracting the infection particularly when applying respiratory devices such as oxygen cannulas or noninvasive ventilation. The aim of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the correct use of ""respiratory devices"" in the COVID-19 emergency and protect healthcare workers from contracting the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY REVIEW,200068,Protecting healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection: practical indications,"作者:Ferioli, M (Ferioli, Martina)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Cisternino, C (Cisternino, Cecilia)[ 4,5 ] ; Leo, V (Leo, Valentina)[ 4,5 ] ; Pisani, L (Pisani, Lara)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Palange, P (Palange, Paolo)[ 4,5 ] ; Nava, S (Nava, Stefano)[ 1,2,3 ]",研究方向:Respiratory System,,出版年: MAR 31 2020,"Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Publ Hlth & Infect Dis, Via Univ 37, I-00185 Rome, Italy.

"摘要
The novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in mainland China has rapidly spread across the globe. Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; surveillance; screening; disease importation,文献类型:Article,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.2002616117,Impact of international travel and border control measures on the global spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus outbreak,"作者:Wells, CR (Wells, Chad R.)[ 1 ] ; Sah, P (Sah, Pratha)[ 1 ] ; Moghadas, SM (Moghadas, Seyed M.)[ 2 ] ; Pandey, A (Pandey, Abhishek)[ 1 ] ; Shoukat, A (Shoukat, Affan)[ 1 ] ; Wang, YN (Wang, Yaning)[ 3 ] ; Wang, Z (Wang, Zheng)[ 4 ] ; Meyers, LA (Meyers, Lauren A.)[ 5,6 ] ; Singer, BH (Singer, Burton H.)[ 7 ] ; Galvani, AP (Galvani, Alison P.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,,出版年: MAR 31 2020,"Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.

"摘要
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and gradually spread to other areas in China. After implementation of prevention and control measures, the estimation of the epidemic trend is needed. A phase- and region-adjusted SEIR model was applied for modeling and predicting the number of cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province and regions outside Hubei Province in China. The estimated number of infections could reach its peak in late February 2020 in Wuhan and Hubei Province, which is 55 303-84 520 and 83 944-129 312, respectively, while the epidemic peaks in regions outside Hubei Province in China could appear on February 13, 2020 with the estimated 13 035-19 108 cases. According to the estimation, the outbreak would abate in March and April all over China. Current estimation provided evidence for planned work resumption under stringent prevention and control in China to further support the fight against the epidemic. Nevertheless, there is still possibility of the second outbreak brought by the work resumption and population migration, especially from Hubei Province and high intensity cities outside Hubei Province. Strict prevention and control measures still need to be considered in the regions with high intensity of epidemic and densely-populated cities.",作者关键词:SEIR model; COVID-19; estimate; China,文献类型:Article; Early Access,FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11684-020-0768-7,Phase- and epidemic region-adjusted estimation of the number of coronavirus disease 2019 cases in China,"作者:Chang, RJ (Chang, Ruijie)[ 1 ] ; Wang, HW (Wang, Huwen)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, SX (Zhang, Shuxian)[ 1 ] ; Wang, ZZ (Wang, Zezhou)[ 2,3 ] ; Dong, YQ (Dong, Yinqiao)[ 4 ] ; Tsamlag, L (Tsamlag, Lhakpa)[ 1 ] ; Yu, XY (Yu, Xiaoyue)[ 1 ] ; Xu, C (Xu, Chen)[ 1 ] ; Yu, YL (Yu, Yuelin)[ 1 ] ; Long, RS (Long, Rusi)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Medicine and Engineering Interdisciplinary Research Fund of Shanghai Jiao Tong University ,MAR 2020,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Sch Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background: As COVID-19 occurs suddenly and is highly contagious, this will inevitably cause people anxiety, depression, etc. The study on the public psychological states and its related factors during the COVID-19 outbreak is of practical significance. Methods: 600 valid questionnaires were received. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used. Results: Females' anxiety risk was 3.01 times compared to males (95% CI 1.39-6.52). Compared with people below 40 years old, the anxiety risk of people above 40 years old was 0.40 times (95% CI 0.16-0.99). SDS results indicated that the difference between education level and occupation was statistically significant (p = 0.024, 0.005). Compared to people with a master's degree or above, those with a bachelor's degree group had a depression risk of 0.39 times (95% CI 0.17-0.87). Compared with professionals, industrial service workers and other staff had a depression risk of 0.31 times (95% CI 0.15-0.65) and 0.38 times (95% CI 0.15-0.93). Conclusions: 600 questionnaire participants were psychologically stable. Non-anxiety and non-depression rates were 93.67% and 82.83%, respectively. There were anxiety in 6.33% and depression in 17.17%. Therefore, we should pay attention to the psychological states of the public.",作者关键词:COVID-19; public psychological states; anxiety; depression; related factors,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE,10.1080/13548506.2020.1746817,Study on the public psychological states and its related factors during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in some regions of China,"作者:Wang, YN (Wang, Yenan)[ 1 ] ; Di, Y (Di, Yu)[ 2 ] ; Ye, JJ (Ye, Junjie)[ 2 ] ; Wei, WB (Wei, Wenbin)[ 3 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,MAR 2020,"Capital Med Univ, Beijing Tongren Hosp,Med Artificial Intelligence, Tongren Eye Ctr,Beijing Ophthalmol & Visual Sci K, Beijing Key Lab Intraocular Tumor Diag & Treatmen, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Viral modernity is a concept based upon the nature of viruses, the ancient and critical role they play in evolution and culture, and the basic application to understanding the role of information and forms of bioinformation in the social world. The concept draws a close association between viral biology on the one hand, and information science on the other - it is an illustration and prime example of bioinformationalism that brings together two of the most powerful forces that now drive cultural evolution. The concept of viral modernity applies to viral technologies, codes and ecosystems in information, publishing, education and emerging knowledge (journal) systems. This paper traces the relationship between epidemics, quarantine, and public health management and outlines elements of viral-digital philosophy (VDP) based on the fusion of living and technological systems. We discuss Covid-19 as a 'bioinformationalist' response that represents historically unprecedented level of sharing information from the sequencing of the genome to testing for a vaccination. Finally, we look at the US response to Covid-19 through the lens of infodemics and post-truth. The paper is followed by three open reviews, which further refine its conclusions as they relate to (educational) philosophy and the notion of the virus as Pharmakon.",作者关键词:bioinformationalism; Covid-19; epidemics; information science; postdigital; viral biology,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY,10.1080/00131857.2020.1744226,"Viral modernity? epidemics, infodemics, and the 'bioinformational' paradigm","作者:Peters, MA (Peters, Michael A.)[ 1 ] ; Jandric, P (Jandric, Petar)[ 2 ] ; McLaren, P (McLaren, Peter)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Education & Educational Research,,MAR 2020,"Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Background:

The current outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus infection among humans in Wuhan (China) and its spreading around the globe is heavily impacting on the global health and mental health. Despite all resources employed to counteract the spreading of the virus, additional global strategies are needed to handle the related mental health issues.

Methods:

Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed.

Comments:

This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. Collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention strategies and decision-making from policy makers, health organizations and medical centers, which can weaken strategies of COVID-19 control and lead to more morbidity and mental health needs at global level.",作者关键词:Outbreak; coronavirus; mental health; COVID-19,文献类型:Review; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY,0020764020915212,The outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus and its impact on global mental health,"作者:Torales, J (Torales, Julio)[ 1 ] ; O'Higgins, M (O'Higgins, Marcelo)[ 1 ] ; Castaldelli-Maia, JM (Castaldelli-Maia, Joao Mauricio)[ 2,3 ] ; Ventriglio, A (Ventriglio, Antonio)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Psychiatry,,10.1177/0020764020915212,"Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Via G Marconi 3, I-71041 Foggia, Italy.

"摘要
Purpose To review the chest computed tomography (CT) findings on the ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) in patients with the Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and Methods In February 2020, six consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (median age, 69 years) underwent U-HR CT imaging. U-HR-CT has a larger matrix size of 1024 x 1024 thinner slice thickness of 0.25 mm and can demonstrate terminal bronchioles in the normal lungs; as a result, Reid's secondary lobules and their abnormalities can be identified. The distribution and hallmarks (ground-glass opacity, consolidation with or without architectural distortion, linear opacity, crazy paving) of the lung opacities on U-HRCT were visually evaluated on a 1 K monitor by two experienced reviewers. The CT lung volume was measured, and the ratio of the measured lung volume to the predicted total lung capacity (predTLC) based on sex, age and height was calculated. Results All cases showed crazy paving pattern in U-HRCT. In these lesions, the secondary lobules were smaller than those in the un-affected lungs. CT lung volume decreased in two cases comparing predTLC. Conclusion U-HRCT can evaluate not only the distribution and hallmarks of COVID-19 pneumonia but also visualize local lung volume loss.",作者关键词:Novel coronavirus; Ultra-high-resolution computed tomography; Crazy-paving pattern; Pneumonia,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s11604-020-00956-y,Ultra-high-resolution computed tomography can demonstrate alveolar collapse in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia,"作者:Iwasawa, T (Iwasawa, Tae)[ 1,3 ] ; Sato, M (Sato, Midori)[ 2 ] ; Yamaya, T (Yamaya, Takafumi)[ 2 ] ; Sato, Y (Sato, Yozo)[ 2 ] ; Uchida, Y (Uchida, Yoshinori)[ 2 ] ; Kitamura, H (Kitamura, Hideya)[ 2 ] ; Hagiwara, E (Hagiwara, Eri)[ 2 ] ; Komatsu, S (Komatsu, Shigeru)[ 2 ] ; Utsunomiya, D (Utsunomiya, Daisuke)[ 1,3 ] ; Ogura, T (Ogura, Takashi)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,MAR 2020,"Kanagawa Cardiovasc & Resp Ctr, Dept Radiol, Kanazawa Ku, 6-16-1 Tomioka Higashi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360051, Japan.

"摘要
During the 2020 Spring Festival in China, the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named COVID-19 by WHO, brought on a worldwide panic. According to the clinical data of infected patients, radiologic evidence of lung edema is common and deserves clinical attention. Lung edema is a manifestation of acute lung injury (ALI) and may progress to hypoxemia and potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients diagnosed with ARDS have poorer prognosis and potentially higher mortality. Although no effective treatment is formally approved for COVID-19 infection, support of ventilation with oxygen therapy and sometimes mechanical ventilation is often required. Treatment with systemic and/or local glucocorticoids might be helpful to alleviate the pulmonary inflammation and edema, which may decrease the development and/or consequences of ARDS. In this article, we focus on the lung edema and ALI of patients with this widely transmitted COVID-19 infection in order to provide clinical indications and potential therapeutic targets for clinicians and researchers.",作者关键词:ARDS; COVID-19; lung edema,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,10.1002/ctm2.16,Acute lung injury in patients with COVID-19 infection,"作者:Li, L (Li, Liyang)[ 1 ] ; Huang, QH (Huang, Qihong)[ 1 ] ; Wang, DC (Wang, Diane C.)[ 2 ] ; Ingbar, DH (Ingbar, David H.)[ 3 ] ; Wang, XD (Wang, Xiangdong)[ 1,4,5,6 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Shanghai Engineering and Technology Center for Artificial Intelligence of Lung and Heart Diseases from Zhongshan Hospital ,MAR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Shanghai Med Sch, Inst Clin Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

"摘要
A previously unknown beta coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was discovered from a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan since the end of 2019. Ever since the start of COVID-19, government administrations, academic institutions, and technology enterprises are under unprecedented cooperation in controlling this outbreak from pathogen identification, epidemic situation assessment, to outbreak containment. Timely identification, isolation, and whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 have laid the foundation for effective control of this novel infection. With the increasing case numbers worldwide, more real-time information is emerging, changing our understandings to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and nonetheless refining the outbreak control responses. The efficient management of COVID-19 requires global collaboration and an efficient share of information.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,10.1002/ctm2.7,Collaborated effort against SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China,"作者:Yang, QW (Yang, Qiwen)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, Y (Zhou, Yang)[ 2 ] ; Ai, JW (Ai, Jingwen)[ 3 ] ; Ma, JM (Ma, Jinmin)[ 4 ] ; Cao, FL (Cao, Fenglin)[ 5 ] ; Cao, WF (Cao, Weifan)[ 6 ] ; Zhang, WG (Zhang, Wengeng)[ 7,8 ] ; Wang, SF (Wang, Shifu)[ 9 ] ; Chen, WJ (Chen, Weijun)[ 2,4 ] ; Ma, XL (Ma, Xiaoling)[ 10 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Shenzhen Science andTechnologyResearch and Development projects ,MAR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Dept Infect Dis, Huashan Hosp, 12 Wulumuqi Zhong Rd, Shanghai 200040, Peoples R China.

The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised great concern worldwide, but its impact on transplant recipients is unknown. We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a 52-year-old man who received kidney transplantation 12 years ago. His overall clinical characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to those of non-transplanted COVID-19 patients. Following a treatment regimen consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, the COVID-19 pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was successfully recovered. This effectively treated case has reference value for the future treatment of other transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; immunosuppression; pneumonia; renal transplantation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPLANTATION,10.1111/ajt.15869,Successful recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia in a renal transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppression,"作者:Zhu, L (Zhu, Lan)[ 1,2 ] ; Xu, XZ (Xu, Xizhen)[ 3 ] ; Ma, K (Ma, Ke)[ 4 ] ; Yang, JL (Yang, Junling)[ 5 ] ; Guan, HX (Guan, Hanxiong)[ 6 ] ; Chen, S (Chen, Song)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, ZS (Chen, Zhishui)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, G (Chen, Gang)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Surgery; Transplantation,,MAR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Inst Organ Transplantat, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.",,文献类型:Article,CELL RESEARCH,10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV) infection by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion,"作者:Xia, S (Xia, Shuai)[ 1 ] ; Liu, MQ (Liu, Meiqin)[ 2,3 ] ; Wang, C (Wang, Chao)[ 4 ] ; Xu, W (Xu, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Lan, QS (Lan, Qiaoshuai)[ 1 ] ; Feng, SL (Feng, Siliang)[ 4 ] ; Qi, FF (Qi, Feifei)[ 5,6 ] ; Bao, LL (Bao, Linlin)[ 5,6 ] ; Du, LY (Du, Lanying)[ 7 ] ; Liu, SW (Liu, Shuwen)[ 8 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Cell Biology,National Megaprojects of China for Major Infectious Diseases ,出版年: APR 2020,"Fudan Univ, Fudan Jinbo Joint Res Ctr, Sch Basic Med Sci, Key Lab Med Mol Virol MOE NHC CAMS, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Introduction: Novel coronavirus or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can affect all age groups. The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults. It should be noted that, although typical symptoms may be present in children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate. The disease is rare in the neonate, so, its suspicion in this group can help to make a quick diagnose. Case report: A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without cough. His mother had symptoms of Novel coronavirus. So Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was done for the neonate and showed to be positive. The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care. Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated. Eventually, the baby was discharged in good general condition. Conclusion: When a newborn presents with non-specific symptoms of infection with an added history of COVID-19 in his/her parents, it indicates the need for PCR testing for Novel coronavirus.",作者关键词:Neonates; novel coronavirus; COVID-19; sepsis,文献类型:Article,INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1080/23744235.2020.1747634,"Novel coronavirus in a 15-day-old neonate with clinical signs of sepsis, a case report","作者:Aghdam, MK (Aghdam, Mojtaba Kamali)[ 1 ] ; Jafari, N (Jafari, Nahid)[ 2 ] ; Eftekhari, K (Eftekhari, Kambiz)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,出版年: JUN 2 2020,"Bahrami Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Kiaee St, Tehran, Iran.

"摘要
Approximately 90 days of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spreading originally from Wuhan, China, and across the globe has led to a widespread chain of events with imminent threats to the fragile relationship between community health and economic health. Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial ractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate. Th is paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; hospitalization; critical care; mortality; epidemiology; reporting; public health; resource utilization,文献类型:Article,REVIEWS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE,10.31083/j.rcm.2020.01.42,"Urgent need for individual mobile phone and institutional reporting of at home, hospitalized, and intensive care unit cases of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection","作者:McCullough, PA (McCullough, Peter A.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Eidt, J (Eidt, John)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Rangaswami, J (Rangaswami, Janani)[ 4 ] ; Lerma, E (Lerma, Edgar)[ 5 ] ; Tumlin, J (Tumlin, James)[ 6 ] ; Wheelan, K (Wheelan, Kevin)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Katz, N (Katz, Nevin)[ 7 ] ; Lepor, NE (Lepor, Norman E.)[ 8 ] ; Vijay, K (Vijay, Kris)[ 9 ] ; Soman, S (Soman, Sandeep)[ 10 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,出版年: MAR 30 2020,"Baylor Univ, Med Ctr, Dallas, TX 75226 USA.

"摘要
The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) imposes a major challenge in managing patients undergoing surgical operation. In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff. There were 13 males and 12 females. The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years. The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years. By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential ""super spreader"" may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection. It was concluded that Covid-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation, especially for those with COPD. Implementation of comprehensive protective measures is important to control nosocomial infection.",作者关键词:corona virus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2; nosocomial infection,文献类型:Article,CURRENT MEDICAL SCIENCE,10.1007/s11596-020-2176-2,Clinical and Transmission Characteristics of Covid-19-A Retrospective Study of 25 Cases from a Single Thoracic Surgery Department,"作者:Li, YK (Li, Yang-Kai)[ 1 ] ; Peng, S (Peng, Shu)[ 1 ] ; Li, LQ (Li, Le-Qun)[ 1 ] ; Wang, Q (Wang, Qi)[ 1 ] ; Ping, W (Ping, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, N (Zhang, Ni)[ 1 ] ; Fu, XN (Fu, Xiang-Ning)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Tongji Hosp, Dept Thorac Surg, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

Purpose The aim of this short communication is to outline our experience in policies and processes of a nuclear medicine service during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore. Methods We describe the key considerations of policies and processes that have been implemented in our nuclear medicine service since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Singapore General Hospital on 23 January 2020, up to the present time. Results Infection control, screening of patients and visitors, segregation of risk groups, segregation of staff and service continuity plans, communication and staff welfare, using electronic platforms for multi-disciplinary meetings and tele-reporting are discussed. Conclusion Since our hospital received the first patient with COVID-19 in Singapore, our centre has managed 16 COVID-19 cases to date. There has not been any healthcare worker in our institution who has contracted COVID-19 through patient contact. We have highlighted for discussion some of the policies and processes to prepare a nuclear medicine service for the COVID-19 threat.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Nuclear medicine; Infection,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING,10.1007/s00259-020-04790-2,Facing a disruptive threat: how can a nuclear medicine service be prepared for the coronavirus outbreak 2020?,"作者:Lam, WWC (Lam, Winnie Wing-Chuen)[ 1,2 ] ; Loke, KSH (Loke, Kelvin Siu-Hoong)[ 1,2 ] ; Wong, WY (Wong, Wai Yin)[ 1,2 ] ; Ng, DCE (Ng, David Chee-Eng)[ 1,2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,MAR 2020,"Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Nucl Med & Mol Imaging, Div Radiol Sci, Outram Rd, Singapore 169608, Singapore.

Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT to differentiate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in non-high-epidemic area in Japan. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 21 patients clinically suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent chest CT more than 3 days after the symptom onset: six patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 15 patients proved uninfected. Using a Likert scale and its receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, two radiologists (R1/R2) evaluated the diagnostic performance of the five CT criteria: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO)-predominant lesions, (2) GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, (3) bilateral GGO-predominant lesions; (4) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, and (5) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without nodules, airway abnormalities, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Results All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77-0.88 for R1 and 0.78-0.92 for R2. The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC. Conclusion Chest CT would play a supplemental role to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms in a clinical setting.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Chest CT; Diagnostic performance; CT criteria,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s11604-020-00958-w,Diagnostic performance of chest CT to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia in non-high-epidemic area in Japan,"作者:Himoto, Y (Himoto, Yuki)[ 1 ] ; Sakata, A (Sakata, Akihiko)[ 1 ] ; Kirita, M (Kirita, Mitsuhiro)[ 1 ] ; Hiroi, T (Hiroi, Takashi)[ 1 ] ; Kobayashi, K (Kobayashi, Ken-ichiro)[ 2 ] ; Kubo, K (Kubo, Kenji)[ 2 ] ; Kim, H (Kim, Hyunjin)[ 1 ] ; Nishimoto, A (Nishimoto, Azusa)[ 1 ] ; Maeda, C (Maeda, Chikara)[ 1 ] ; Kawamura, A (Kawamura, Akira)[ 1 ] ...更多内容","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,MAR 2020,"Japanese Red Cross Wakayama Med Ctr, Dept Diagnost Radiol, Wakayama 6408558, Japan.

"摘要
On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak of a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO guidance states that patients with (COVID-19) should be managed by staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment; however, working whilst wearing personal protective equipment is unfamiliar to many healthcare professionals. We ran high-fidelity, in-situ simulation of high-risk procedures on patients with COVID-19 in a negative-pressure side room on our intensive care unit (ICU). Our aim was to identify potential problems, test the robustness of our systems and inform modification of our standard operating procedures for any patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICU. The simulations revealed several important latent risks and allowed us to put corrective measures in place before the admission of patients with COVID-19. We recommend that staff working in clinical areas expected to receive patients with COVID-19 conduct in-situ simulation in order to detect their own unique risks and aid in the creation of local guidelines of management of patients with COVID-19.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; intensive care medicine; simulation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15048,Use of in situ simulation to evaluate the operational readiness of a high-consequence infectious disease intensive care unit,"作者:Fregene, TE (Fregene, T.

"摘要
The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus. A total of 5 of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (four [80%] patients), and liver functions alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (four [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed in the hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4 +/- 7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [20%] patients), acute liver injury (three [60%] patients), and diarrhea (two [40%] patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need intensive care unit and were discharged from the hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those coinfection patients.",作者关键词:clinical characteristics; coinfection; COVID-19; influenza virus,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25781,"The clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients coinfected with 2019 novel coronavirus and influenza virus in Wuhan, China","作者:Ding, Q (Ding, Qiang)[ 1 ] ; Lu, PP (Lu, Panpan)[ 1 ] ; Fan, YH (Fan, Yuhui)[ 1,2 ] ; Xia, YJ (Xia, Yujia)[ 1 ] ; Liu, M (Liu, Mei)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,MAR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Gastroenterol, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, 1095 Jiefang Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has posed a serious threat to global public health. The WHO has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection an international public health emergency. Lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. Similarly, previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogenic coronavirus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and associated with the severity of diseases. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection were summarized, which may provide help for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19.",作者关键词:COVID-19; liver injury; MERS; SARS; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,LIVER INTERNATIONAL,10.1111/liv.14435,Liver injury during highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections,"作者:Xu, L (Xu, Ling)[ 1,2 ] ; Liu, J (Liu, Jia)[ 1,2 ] ; Lu, MJ (Lu, Mengji)[ 2,3 ] ; Yang, DL (Yang, Dongliang)[ 1,2 ] ; Zheng, X (Zheng, Xin)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,MAR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Tongji Med Coll, 1277 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Novel coronavirus 2019 is a single-stranded, ribonucleic acid virus that has led to an international pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. Clinical data from the Chinese outbreak have been reported, but experiences and recommendations from clinical practice during the Italian outbreak have not. We report the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on regional and national healthcare infrastructure. We also report on recommendations based on clinical experiences of managing patients throughout Italy. In particular, we describe key elements of clinical management, including: safe oxygen therapy; airway management; personal protective equipment; and non-technical aspects of caring for patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. Only through planning, training and team working will clinicians and healthcare systems be best placed to deal with the many complex implications of this new pandemic.",作者关键词:COVID-19; critical care; tracheal intubation; ventilation,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ANAESTHESIA,10.1111/anae.15049,The Italian coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: recommendations from clinical practice,"作者:Sorbello, M (Sorbello, M.)[ 1 ] ; El-Boghdadly, K (El-Boghdadly, K.)[ 2 ] ; Di Giacinto, I (Di Giacinto, I)[ 3 ] ; Cataldo, R (Cataldo, R.)[ 4 ] ; Esposito, C (Esposito, C.)[ 5 ] ; Falcetta, S (Falcetta, S.)[ 6 ] ; Merli, G (Merli, G.)[ 7 ] ; Cortese, G (Cortese, G.)[ 8 ] ; Corso, RM (Corso, R.

"摘要
By 27 February 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013, respectively. COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days. The basic reproductive number (R-0) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions. This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID-19 and enhance our control measures in the future.",作者关键词:COVID-19; diagnosis and interventions; features,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25748,Unique epidemiological and clinical features of the emerging 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) implicate special control measures,"作者:Wang, YX (Wang, Yixuan)[ 1 ] ; Wang, YY (Wang, Yuyi)[ 1 ] ; Chen, Y (Chen, Yan)[ 2 ] ; Qin, QS (Qin, Qingsong)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,Department of Education of Guangdong province of China ,出版年: JUN 2020,"Shantou Univ, Lab Human Virol & Oncol, Med Coll, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Health professions preventing and controlling Coronavirus Disease 2019 are prone to skin and mucous membrane injury, which may cause acute and chronic dermatitis, secondary infection and aggravation of underlying skin diseases. This is a consensus of Chinese experts on protective measures and advice on hand-cleaning- and medical-glove-related hand protection, mask- and goggles-related face protection, UV-related protection, eye protection, nasal and oral mucosa protection, outer ear, and hair protection. It is necessary to strictly follow standards of wearing protective equipment and specification of sterilizing and cleaning. Insufficient and excessive protection will have adverse effects on the skin and mucous membrane barrier.

Objective This study aims to evaluate the correlation between viral clearance and blood biochemical index of 94 discharged patients with COVID-19 infection in Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, enrolled from Jan 5 to Feb 13, 2020. Methods The clinical and laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients. The data were analysed and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Information on clinical signs and symptoms, medical treatment, virus clearance, and laboratory parameters including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein were collected. Results COVID-19 mRNA clearance ratio was identified significantly correlated with the decline of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Furthermore, COVID-19 mRNA clearance time was positively correlated with the length of hospital stay in patients treated with either IFN-alpha + lopinavir/ritonavir or IFN-alpha + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin. Conclusions Therapeutic regimens of IFN-alpha + lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-alpha + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin might be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19.

"摘要
Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has created pandemic in the world as declared by WHO on March 12, 2020. It is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV 2 virus and has affected large populations in over 120 countries. There is no specific treatment available and management is empirical. Until such time that an effective vaccine is available for COVID-19 viral infection, one can repurpose known therapeutic drug molecules such as angiotensin receptor 2 blocker, a commonly used antihypertensive drug, to control COVID-19 virus from gaining entry into the host cell by blocking the angiotensin receptor. Clinical trials should also be undertaken to use statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs but have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties to prevent acute lung injury in COVID-19 infection.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH,10.1002/ddr.21666,COVID-19 treatment by repurposing drugs until the vaccine is in sight,"作者:Phadke, M (Phadke, Mrudula)[ 1 ] ; Saunik, S (Saunik, Sujata)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,MAR 2020,"Maharashtra Univ Hlth Sci, Govt Maharashtra, UNICEF, NHM, Nasik, Maharashtra, India.

"摘要
Background Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020.

Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2.

Findings As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3-6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days.

Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"摘要
Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.

Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions).

Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [ 20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5).

Interpretation Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control. Copyright (C) 2020. World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"摘要
Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.

Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (>= 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.

Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17, per year increase; p=0.0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5.65, 2.61-12.23; p<0.0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 mu g/mL (18.42, 2.64-128.55; p=0.0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20.0 days (IQR 17.0-24.0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.

Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mu g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"摘要
Background The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. Methods We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. Results The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS CoV-2; Clinical practice guidelines; Critical illness,文献类型:Article; Early Access,INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE,10.1007/s00134-020-06022-5,Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"作者:Alhazzani, W (Alhazzani, Waleed)[ 1,2 ] ; Moller, MH (Moller, Morten Hylander)[ 3,4 ] ; Arabi, YM (Arabi, Yaseen M.)[ 5 ] ; Loeb, M (Loeb, Mark)[ 1,2 ] ; Gong, MN (Gong, Michelle Ng)[ 6 ] ; Fan, E (Fan, Eddy)[ 7 ] ; Oczkowski, S (Oczkowski, Simon)[ 1,2 ] ; Levy, MM (Levy, Mitchell M.)[ 8,9 ] ; Derde, L (Derde, Lennie)[ 10,11 ] ; Dzierba, A (Dzierba, Amy)[ 12 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,MAR 2020,"St Georges Univ London, London, England.

"摘要
The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is quickly spreading across China and globally. Pharmacy services are an important pillar in public health to prevent and contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese pharmacists have acted swiftly in the public health response in China, such as drafting professional service guidance to pharmacists and pharmacies, establishing emergency drug formularies, monitoring and resolving drug shortages, establishing remote pharmacy services to prevent human-to-human infections, providing event-driven pharmaceutical care, educating the public on infection prevention and disease management, and participating in clinical trials and drug evaluation. This commentary reviews the unique needs of pharmacy services in the COVID-19 pandemic, and shares our experiences with the international pharmacy community in the response to these needs.",作者关键词:China; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pharmaceutical care; Pharmacists; Pharmacy service; Public health,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY,10.1007/s11096-020-01017-0,Providing pharmacy services during the coronavirus pandemic,"作者:Liu, S (Liu, Shao)[ 1,2 ] ; Luo, P (Luo, Ping)[ 1,2 ] ; Tang, MM (Tang, Mimi)[ 1,2 ] ; Hu, Q (Hu, Qin)[ 1,2 ] ; Polidoro, JP (Polidoro, Joseph P.)[ 3 ] ; Sun, SS (Sun, Shusen)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Gong, ZH (Gong, Zhicheng)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,MAR 2020,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Dept Pharm, Changsha 410008, Hunan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in China and all over the world now. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.",作者关键词:coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25766,Coronavirus disease 2019: What we know?,"作者:He, F (He, Feng)[ 1 ] ; Deng, Y (Deng, Yu)[ 1 ] ; Li, WN (Li, Weina)[ 2,3 ]",研究方向:Virology,,MAR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Infect Dis, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The recent emergence of COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide crisis, with large populations locked down and transportation links severed. While approximately 80% of infected individuals have minimal symptoms, around 15-20% need to be hospitalized, greatly stressing global healthcare systems. As of March 10, the death rate appears to be about 3.4%, although this number is highly stratified among different populations. Here, we focus on those individuals who have been exposed to nicotine prior to their exposure to the virus. We predict that these individuals are 'primed' to be at higher risk because nicotine can directly impact the putative receptor for the virus (ACE2) and lead to deleterious signaling in lung epithelial cells.",作者关键词:addiction; infectious Disease; pandemic; public Health; tobacco,文献类型:Article; Early Access,FEBS JOURNAL,10.1111/febs.15303,Is nicotine exposure linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 in the general population?,"作者:Olds, JL (Olds, James L.)[ 1 ] ; Kabbani, N (Kabbani, Nadine)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,,MAR 2020,"George Mason Univ, SCHAR Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.

"摘要
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that is causing the serious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length human ACE2 in the presence of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 with or without the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 angstroms, with a local resolution of 3.5 angstroms at the ACE2-RBD interface. The ACE2-B0AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the collectrin-like domain of ACE2 mediating homodimerization. The RBD is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. These findings provide important insights into the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.",,文献类型:Article,SCIENCE,10.1126/science.abb2762,Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2,"作者:Yan, RH (Yan, Renhong)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhang, YY (Zhang, Yuanyuan)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, YN (Li, Yaning)[ 3 ] ; Xia, L (Xia, Lu)[ 1,2 ] ; Guo, YY (Guo, Yingying)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhou, Q (Zhou, Qiang)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: MAR 27 2020,"Westlake Inst Adv Study, Key Lab Struct Biol Zhejiang Prov, Inst Biol, 18 Shilongshan Rd, Hangzhou 310024, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The need to protect public health during the current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated conference cancellations on an unprecedented scale. As the scientific community adapts to new working conditions, it is important to recognize that some of our actions may disproportionately affect early-career researchers and scientists from countries with limited research funding. We encourage all conference organizers, funders and institutions who are able to do so to consider how they can mitigate the unintended consequences of conference and travel cancellations and we provide seven recommendations for how this could be achieved. The proposed solutions may also offer long-term benefits for those who normally cannot attend conferences, and thus lead to a more equitable future for generations of researchers.",,文献类型:Editorial Material,ELIFE,e57032,POINT OF VIEW Mitigating the impact of conference and travel cancellations on researchers' futures,"作者:Weissgerber, T (Weissgerber, Tracey)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Bediako, Y (Bediako, Yaw)[ 4,5 ] ; de Winde, CM (de Winde, Charlotte M.)[ 4,6 ] ; Ebrahimi, H (Ebrahimi, Hedyeh)[ 4,7 ] ; Fernandez-Chiappe, F (Fernandez-Chiappe, Florencia)[ 4,8 ] ; Ilangovan, V (Ilangovan, Vinodh)[ 4,9 ] ; Mehta, D (Mehta, Devang)[ 4,10 ] ; Quezada, CP (Paz Quezada, Carolina)[ 4,11 ] ; Riley, JL (Riley, Julia L.)[ 4,12,13 ] ; Saladi, SM (Saladi, Shyam M.)[ 4,14 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,出版年: MAR 27 2020,"Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin Inst Hlth, ELifes Early Career Advisory Grp, Berlin, Germany.

"摘要
Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. However, little is currently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.",,文献类型:Article,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,1620,Characterization of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on virus entry and its immune cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV,"作者:Ou, XY (Ou, Xiuyuan)[ 1 ] ; Liu, Y (Liu, Yan)[ 1 ] ; Lei, XB (Lei, Xiaobo)[ 1 ] ; Li, P (Li, Pei)[ 1 ] ; Mi, D (Mi, Dan)[ 1 ] ; Ren, LL (Ren, Lili)[ 1 ] ; Guo, L (Guo, Li)[ 1 ] ; Guo, RX (Guo, Ruixuan)[ 1 ] ; Chen, T (Chen, Ting)[ 1 ] ; Hu, JX (Hu, Jiaxin)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,Chinese Science and Technology Key Projects ,出版年: MAR 27 2020,"Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Inst Pathogen Biol, NHC Key Lab Syst Biol Pathogens, Beijing 100176, Peoples R China.

"摘要
As of March 8, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had caused 80,815 human infections and 3073 deaths in China, including more than 3000 infections among medical staff. Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital (Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China), a provincial emergency hospital, has treated more than 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 260 suspected cases. Most of nurses' work involves direct contact with patients. As nurses have high vulnerability to COVID-19, it is necessary to establish hospital-specific protocols to reduce the risk of nurses' infection in interactions with COVID-19 patients. Our hospital has maintained a ""zero nurse infection"" rate while battling SARS in 2003 and during the present COVID-19 epidemic.

Background The emergence of the COVID-19 and its consequences has led to fears, worries, and anxiety among individuals worldwide. The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases. Methods The sample comprised 717 Iranian participants. The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. Results After panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (alpha = .82) and test-retest reliability (ICC = .72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459). Conclusion The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Fear; Iran; Psychometrics; Fear of COVID-19 Scale,文献类型:Article; Early Access,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION,10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8,The Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Development and Initial Validation,"作者:Ahorsu, DK (Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi)[ 1 ] ; Lin, CY (Lin, Chung-Ying)[ 1 ] ; Imani, V (Imani, Vida)[ 2 ] ; Saffari, M (Saffari, Mohsen)[ 3 ] ; Griffiths, MD (Griffiths, Mark D.)[ 4 ] ; Pakpour, AH (Pakpour, Amir H.)[ 5,6 ]",研究方向:Psychology; Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,,MAR 2020,"Nottingham Trent Univ, Psychol Dept, Int Gaming Res Unit, 50 Shakespeare St, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England.

"摘要
The emergence of the novel betacoronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised serious concerns due to the virus's rapid dissemination worldwide. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Italy from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analyzed complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and understanding of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.",作者关键词:COVID-19; epidemic; Italian outbreak; phylogenetic inference,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25773,A doubt of multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy: A preliminary overview,"作者:Giovanetti, M (Giovanetti, Marta)[ 1,2 ] ; Angeletti, S (Angeletti, Silvia)[ 3 ] ; Benvenuto, D (Benvenuto, Domenico)[ 4 ] ; Ciccozzi, M (Ciccozzi, Massimo)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Virology,Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ),MAR 2020,"Univ Campus Biomed Rome, Unit Clin Lab Sci, Via Alvaro del Portillo 200, I-00128 Rome, Italy.

"摘要
Structure-based stabilization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy for drug discovery. However, this approach has mainly focused on the stabilization of native PPIs, and non-native PPIs have received little consideration. Here, we identified a non-native interaction interface on the three-dimensional dimeric structure of the N-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (MERS-CoV N-NTD). The interface formed a conserved hydrophobic cavity suitable for targeted drug screening. By considering the hydrophobic complementarity during the virtual screening step, we identified 5-benzyloxygramine as a new N protein PPI orthosteric stabilizer that exhibits both antiviral and N-NTD protein-stabilizing activities. X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering showed that 5-benzyloxygramine stabilizes the N-NTD dimers through simultaneous hydrophobic interactions with both partners, resulting in abnormal N protein oligomerization that was further confirmed in the cell. This unique approach based on the identification and stabilization of non-native PPIs of N protein could be applied toward drug discovery against CoV diseases.",,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01913,Structure-Based Stabilization of Non-native Protein-Protein Interactions of Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Proteins in Antiviral Drug Design,"作者:Lin, SM (Lin, Shan-Meng)[ 1,2 ] ; Lin, SC (Lin, Shih-Chao)[ 3 ] ; Hsu, JN (Hsu, Jia-Ning)[ 1,2 ] ; Chang, CK (Chang, Chung-ke)[ 4 ] ; Chien, CM (Chien, Ching-Ming)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, YS (Wang, Yong-Sheng)[ 1 ] ; Wu, HY (Wu, Hung-Yi)[ 5 ] ; Jeng, US (Jeng, U-Ser)[ 6,7 ] ; Kehn-Hall, K (Kehn-Hall, Kylene)[ 3 ] ; Hou, MH (Hou, Ming-Hon)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,MOST ,出版年: MAR 26 2020,"Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Genom & Bioinformat, Taichung 402, Taiwan.

"摘要
Few novel or emerging infectious diseases have posed such vital ethical challenges so quickly and dramatically as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern and recently classified Covid-19 as a worldwide pandemic. As of this writing, the epidemic has not yet peaked in the United States, but community transmission is widespread. President Trump declared a national emergency as fifty governors declared state emergencies. In the coming weeks, hospitals will become overrun, stretched to their capacities. When the health system becomes stretched beyond capacity, how can we ethically allocate scarce health goods and services? How can we ensure that marginalized populations can access the care they need? What ethical duties do we owe to vulnerable people separated from their families and communities? And how do we ethically and legally balance public health with civil liberties?",作者关键词:novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2; Covid-19; public health emergency; allocation of scarce resources; public health ethics; crisis standards of care; civil liberties,文献类型:Article,HASTINGS CENTER REPORT,10.1002/hast.1090,Responding to Covid-19: How to Navigate a Public Health Emergency Legally and Ethically,"作者:Gostin, LO (Gostin, Lawrence O.)[ 1,2 ] ; Friedman, EA (Friedman, Eric A.)[ 3 ] ; Wetter, SA (Wetter, Sarah A.)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Ethics; Biomedical Social Sciences,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Georgetown Univ, Global Hlth Law, Washington, DC 20057 USA.

OBJECTIVE

To delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.

DESIGN

Retrospective case series.

SETTING

Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.

PARTICIPANTS

Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection

RESULTS

The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.

CONCLUSION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.",,文献类型:Article,BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL,m1091,Clinical characteristics of 113 deceased patients with coronavirus disease 2019: retrospective study,"作者:Chen, T (Chen, Tao)[ 1 ] ; Wu, D (Wu, Di)[ 1 ] ; Chen, HL (Chen, Huilong)[ 1 ] ; Yan, WM (Yan, Weiming)[ 1 ] ; Yang, DL (Yang, Danlei)[ 2 ] ; Chen, G (Chen, Guang)[ 1 ] ; Ma, K (Ma, Ke)[ 1 ] ; Xu, D (Xu, Dong)[ 1 ] ; Yu, HJ (Yu, Haijing)[ 1 ] ; Wang, HW (Wang, Hongwu)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,Tongji Hospital for Pilot Scheme Project ,出版年: MAR 26 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Dept & Inst Infect Dis, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

"摘要
As interest in and use of telehealth during the COVID-19 global pandemic increase, the potential of digital health to increase access and quality of mental health is becoming clear. Although the world today must ""flatten the curve"" of spread of the virus, we argue that now is the time to ""accelerate and bend the curve"" on digital health. Increased investments in digital health today will yield unprecedented access to high-quality mental health care. Focusing on personal experiences and projects from our diverse authorship team, we share selected examples of digital health innovations while acknowledging that no single piece can discuss all the impressive global efforts past and present. Exploring the success of telehealth during the present crisis and how technologies like apps can soon play a larger role, we discuss the need for workforce training, high-quality evidence, and digital equity among other factors critical for bending the curve further.",作者关键词:digital health; emergency response; telehealth; apps,文献类型:Editorial Material,JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,e18848,Digital Mental Health and COVID-19: Using Technology Today to Accelerate the Curve on Access and Quality Tomorrow,"作者:Torous, J (Torous, John)[ 1 ] ; Myrick, KJ (Myrick, Keris Jan)[ 2 ] ; Rauseo-Ricupero, N (Rauseo-Ricupero, Natali)[ 1 ] ; Firth, J (Firth, Joseph)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Psychiatry,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we set up a team to carry out sampling in the community.

Background Since December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China and even the world. We sought to analyse the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of some cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia . Methods In this retrospective study, we extracted the data on 95 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from January 16th to February 25th, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and abnormal radiologic findings. Outcomes were followed up until March 2th, 2020. Results Higher temperature, blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, alanine aminotransferase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity, alpha - hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and so were lower lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage and total protein level. Age below 40 or above 60 years old, male, higher Creatinine level, and lower platelet count also seemed related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, however the P values were greater than 0.05, which mean under the same condition studies of larger samples are needed in the future.

"摘要
Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to the public health and life in China. Unlike the other 6 identified coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety of manifestations. In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission. Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience. These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve 'zero infection' of doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight 2019-nCoV infection.",作者关键词:SARS-CoV-2; Neurosurgery; Diagnosis; Treatment; Prevention,文献类型:Article,CURRENT MEDICAL SCIENCE,10.1007/s11596-020-2173-5,Preliminary Recommendations for Surgical Practice of Neurosurgery Department in the Central Epidemic Area of 2019 Coronavirus Infection,"作者:Tan, YT (Tan, Yu-tang)[ 1 ] ; Wang, JW (Wang, Jun-wen)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, K (Zhao, Kai)[ 1 ] ; Han, L (Han, Lin)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, HQ (Zhang, Hua-qiu)[ 1 ] ; Niu, HQ (Niu, Hong-quan)[ 1 ] ; Shu, K (Shu, Kai)[ 1 ] ; Lei, T (Lei, Ting)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,,出版年: APR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Neurosurg, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

Since December 2019, novel coronavirus infected pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were a concern. We sought to describe the platelet feature of these cases. Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and nonsevere patients were compared. Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients. The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was longer than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19.",作者关键词:coronavirus disease; cytokine storm; platelet value; platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio; risk factor,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25767,Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease-19,"作者:Qu, R (Qu, Rong)[ 1 ] ; Ling, Y (Ling, Yun)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, YHZ (Zhang, Yi-hui-zhi)[ 2 ] ; Wei, LY (Wei, Li-ya)[ 2 ] ; Chen, X (Chen, Xiao)[ 2 ] ; Li, XM (Li, Xu-mian)[ 2 ] ; Liu, XY (Liu, Xuan-yong)[ 2 ] ; Liu, HM (Liu, Han-mian)[ 1 ] ; Guo, Z (Guo, Zhi)[ 2,5 ] ; Ren, H (Ren, Hua)[ 3,4 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,,MAR 2020,"Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Natl Clin Res Canc Canc, Canc Hosp & Shenzhen Hosp, Dept Hematol & Oncol,Natl Canc Ctr, Shenzhen 518116, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Previous studies reported that Stat5 promotes adipogenesis and white adipocyte differentiation. However, the role of Stat5 in brown adipocyte development is poorly understood. We found Stat5a was higher expressed in brown adipocytes than in white adipocytes, and its level was increased during the process of brown adipocyte differentiation. In addition, Stat5a expression was affected by cold stress and high-fat diet-feeding, suggesting a potential role in thermogenesis. Knockdown of Stat5a induced downregulation of brown fat specific genes (UCP1, PGC-1 alpha, Acox-1 and Cidea), while overexpression of Stat5a did the opposite effect. What is more, bioinformatics analysis, ChIP assay and Luciferase activity assay all verified that Stat5a directly bind and transactivate Kdm6a promoter (Lysine-specific demethylase 6A). Further, we found that Stat5a overexpression promoted the expression of Kdm6a and inhibited the trimethylation of H3K27. While inhibiting of Kdm6a reversed the promoting effect of Stat5a overexpression on the expression of brown fat specific genes. Therefore, we conclude that Stat5a participated in brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenic program through binding and transactivating the Kdm6a promoter.",作者关键词:Stat5a; Kdm6a axis; brown adipocyte differentiation; thermogenic program,文献类型:Article,CELL CYCLE,10.1080/15384101.2020.1731644,Stat5a promotes brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenic program through binding and transactivating the Kdm6a promoter,"作者:Liu, WH (Liu, Weihua)[ 1,2 ] ; Ji, YQ (Ji, Yuqiang)[ 3 ] ; Zhang, BN (Zhang, Beining)[ 2 ] ; Chu, HP (Chu, Haiping)[ 2 ] ; Yin, CY (Yin, Chunyan)[ 1 ] ; Xiao, YF (Xiao, Yanfeng)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Cell Biology,Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China ,出版年: APR 17 2020,"Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Pediat, Xian, Peoples R China.

"摘要
For the last 50 years we have known of a broad-spectrum agent tilorone dihydrochloride (Tilorone). This is a small-molecule orally bioavailable drug that was originally discovered in the USA and is currently used clinically as an antiviral in Russia and the Ukraine. Over the years there have been numerous clinical and non-clinical reports of its broad spectrum of antiviral activity. More recently we have identified additional promising antiviral activities against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Chikungunya, Ebola and Marburg which highlights that this old drug may have other uses against new viruses. This may in turn inform the types of drugs that we need for virus outbreaks such as for the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Tilorone has been long neglected by the west in many respects but it deserves further reassessment in light of current and future needs for broad-spectrum antivirals.",作者关键词:Antiviral; broad spectrum; interferon inducers; respiratory virus infections,文献类型:Article,PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH,10.1007/s11095-020-02799-8,Tilorone: a Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Invented in the USA and Commercialized in Russia and beyond,"作者:Ekins, S (Ekins, Sean)[ 1 ] ; Lane, TR (Lane, Thomas R.)[ 1 ] ; Madrid, PB (Madrid, Peter B.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,NIH from NCATS ,出版年: MAR 25 2020,"Collaborat Pharmaceut Inc, 840 Main Campus Dr,Lab 3510, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.

"摘要
Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this disease has spread rapidly around the globe. Considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines. To support the current research and development, CAS has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the CAS content collection. It highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication. The drug-repurposing effort documented herein focuses primarily on agents known to be effective against other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The patent analysis of coronavirus-related biologics includes therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression as well as various types of vaccines. More than 500 patents disclose methodologies of these four biologics with the potential for treating and preventing coronavirus infections, which may be applicable to COVID-19. The information included in this report provides a strong intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines.",,文献类型:Article,ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE,10.1021/acscentsci.0c00272,Research and Development on Therapeutic Agents and Vaccines for COVID-19 and Related Human Coronavirus Diseases,"作者:Liu, C (Liu, Cynthia)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, QQ (Zhou, Qiongqiong)[ 1 ] ; Li, YZ (Li, Yingzhu)[ 1 ] ; Garner, LV (Garner, Linda, V)[ 1 ] ; Watkins, SP (Watkins, Steve P.)[ 1 ] ; Carter, LJ (Carter, Linda J.)[ 1 ] ; Smoot, J (Smoot, Jeffrey)[ 1 ] ; Gregg, AC (Gregg, Anne C.)[ 1 ] ; Daniels, AD (Daniels, Angela D.)[ 1 ] ; Jervey, S (Jervey, Susan)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Chemistry,,出版年: MAR 25 2020,"CAS, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

"摘要
Objectives To explore the relationship between the imaging manifestations and clinical classification of COVID-19. Methods We conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients with COVID-19 from Jan. 18, 2020 to Feb. 7, 2020 in Zhuhai, China. Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. Results This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962-0.985). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918. The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Conclusions The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for independent screening tool.

Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world. Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere. To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports. All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history. The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.",,文献类型:Article; Data Paper,SCIENTIFIC DATA,106,"Epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak, real-time case information","作者:Xu, B (Xu, Bo)[ 1,2 ] ; Gutierrez, B (Gutierrez, Bernardo)[ 2,10 ] ; Mekaru, S (Mekaru, Sumiko)[ 3,4 ] ; Sewalk, K (Sewalk, Kara)[ 3 ] ; Goodwin, L (Goodwin, Lauren)[ 3 ] ; Loskill, A (Loskill, Alyssa)[ 3,11 ] ; Cohn, EL (Cohn, Emily L.)[ 3 ] ; Hswen, Y (Hswen, Yulin)[ 3 ] ; Hill, SC (Hill, Sarah C.)[ 2 ] ; Cobo, MM (Cobo, Maria M.)[ 10,12 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,Branco Weiss Fellowship ,出版年: MAR 24 2020,"Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England.

Objectives To systematically analyze CT findings during the early and progressive stages of natural course of coronavirus disease 2019 and also to explore possible changes in pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities during these two stages. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. Results In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening. The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (p = 0.004). Conclusions Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019. CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease. If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Coronavirus; Pneumonia; Spiral CT scan,文献类型:Article; Early Access,EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00330-020-06816-7,Coronavirus disease 2019: initial chest CT findings,"作者:Zhou, ZM (Zhou, Zhiming)[ 1 ] ; Guo, DJ (Guo, Dajing)[ 1 ] ; Li, CM (Li, Chuanming)[ 1 ] ; Fang, Z (Fang, Zheng)[ 1 ] ; Chen, LL (Chen, Linli)[ 1 ] ; Yang, R (Yang, Ran)[ 2 ] ; Li, X (Li, Xiang)[ 2 ] ; Zeng, WB (Zeng, Wenbing)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",National Natural Science Foundation of China,MAR 2020,"Chongqing Three Gorges Cent Hosp, Dept Radiol, Chongqing 404000, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached Germany. The majority of people infected present with mild disease, but there are severe cases that need intensive care. Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung function. Diagnosis relies on PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract. Severe ARDS reflects the hallmark of a critical course of the disease. Preventing nosocomial infections (primarily by correct use of personal protective equipment) and maintenance of hospitals' operational capability are of utmost importance. Departments of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and emergency medicine will envisage major challenges.",作者关键词:Infectious disease outbreaks; Infection control; Emergency medicine; Anesthesiology; Intensive care,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ANAESTHESIST,10.1007/s00101-020-00760-3,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): update for anesthesiologists and intensivists March 2020,"作者:Thomas-Ruddel, D (Thomas-Rueddel, D.)[ 1,2 ] ; Winning, J (Winning, J.)[ 1 ] ; Dickmann, P (Dickmann, P.)[ 1,2 ] ; Ouart, D (Ouart, D.)[ 1,2 ] ; Kortgen, A (Kortgen, A.)[ 1 ] ; Janssens, U (Janssens, U.)[ 3 ] ; Bauer, M (Bauer, M.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology,,MAR 2020,"Jena Univ Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Intens Care Med, Klinikum 1, D-07747 Jena, Germany.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 because of its rapid worldwide spread. In the operating room, as part of hospital outbreak response measures, anesthesiologists are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to individual patients. In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists can reduce exposure to patients' respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. To avoid any airway manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an infection risk. Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory function, avoidance of aerosolization and hence viral transmission. This article explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures geared towards ensuring patient and staff safety, equipment protection, and infection prevention. By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have downstream implications in the way we practice infection control in anesthesia, with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not the first, and certainly will not be the last novel virus that will lead to worldwide outbreaks. Having a well thought out regional anesthesia plan to manage these patients in this new normal will ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the perioperative management team.",,文献类型:Review; Early Access,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE,10.1007/s12630-020-01637-0,Practical considerations for performing regional anesthesia: lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic,"作者:Lie, SA (Lie, Sui An)[ 1 ] ; Wong, SW (Wong, Sook Wai)[ 1 ] ; Wong, LT (Wong, Loong Tat)[ 1 ] ; Wong, TGL (Wong, Theodore Gar Ling)[ 1 ] ; Chong, SY (Chong, Shin Yuet)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology,,MAR 2020,"Singapore Gen Hosp, Div Anesthesiol & Perioperat Med, Outram Rd, Singapore 169608, Singapore.

"摘要
Since December 2019, COVID-19 has occurred unexpectedly and emerged as a health problem worldwide. Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and >= 6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged.

"摘要
As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging. It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19 outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.",作者关键词:Drive-through; Screening; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Outbreak,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e123,Drive-Through Screening Center for COVID-19: a Safe and Efficient Screening System against Massive Community Outbreak,"作者:Kwon, KT (Kwon, Ki Tae)[ 1 ] ; Ko, JH (Ko, Jae-Hoon)[ 2 ] ; Shin, H (Shin, Heejun)[ 3 ] ; Sung, M (Sung, Minki)[ 4 ] ; Kim, JY (Kim, Jin Yong)[ 5 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: MAR 23 2020,"Incheon Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis, 217 Bangchuk Ro, Incheon 22532, South Korea.

"摘要
The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the first pediatric case ofCOVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy ofself-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COvID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Children,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e124,First Pediatric Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea,"作者:Park, JY (Park, Ji Young)[ 1,6 ] ; Han, MS (Han, Mi Seon)[ 2,7 ] ; Park, KU (Park, Kyoung Un)[ 3 ] ; Kim, JY (Kim, Ji Young)[ 4 ] ; Choi, EH (Choi, Eun Hwa)[ 2,5 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: MAR 23 2020,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Pediat, Childrens Hosp, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea.

"摘要
Importance Health care workers exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be psychologically stressed. Objective To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. Design, Settings, and Participants This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. Main Outcomes and Measures The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.

This cross-sectional study assesses the magnitude of mental health consequences and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.

Question What factors are associated with mental health outcomes among health care workers in China who are treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Findings In this cross-sectional study of 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in multiple regions of China, a considerable proportion of health care workers reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, especially women, nurses, those in Wuhan, and front-line health care workers directly engaged in diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Meaning These findings suggest that, among Chinese health care workers exposed to COVID-19, women, nurses, those in Wuhan, and front-line health care workers have a high risk of developing unfavorable mental health outcomes and may need psychological support or interventions.",,文献类型:Article,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3976,Factors Associated With Mental Health Outcomes Among Health Care Workers Exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019,"作者:Lai, JB (Lai, Jianbo)[ 1 ] ; Ma, SM (Ma, Simeng)[ 2 ] ; Wang, Y (Wang, Ying)[ 2 ] ; Cai, ZX (Cai, Zhongxiang)[ 2 ] ; Hu, JB (Hu, Jianbo)[ 1 ] ; Wei, N (Wei, Ning)[ 1 ] ; Wu, J (Wu, Jiang)[ 3 ] ; Du, H (Du, Hui)[ 4 ] ; Chen, TT (Chen, Tingting)[ 5 ] ; Li, RT (Li, Ruiting)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,National Key Research and Development Program of China ,出版年: MAR 23 2020,"Zhejiang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, 79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou 310003, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak of a novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the 2019-nCoV infection) in December 2019 is one of the most severe public health emergencies since the founding of People's Republic of China in 1949. Healthcare personnel (HCP) nationwide are facing heavy workloads and high risk of infection, especially those who care for patients at the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei Province. Sadly, as of February 20, 2020, over two thousand COVID-19 cases are confirmed among HCP from 476 hospitals nationwide, with nearly 90% of them from Hubei Province. Based on literature search and interviews with some HCP working at Wuhan, capital city of Hubei, we have summarized some of the effective measures taken to reduce infection among HCP, and also made suggestions for improving occupational safety during an infectious disease outbreak. The experience and lessons learned should be a valuable asset for international health community to contain the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic around the world.",作者关键词:healthcare personnel; COVID-19; infectious diseases,文献类型:Article; Early Access,FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11684-020-0765-x,Protecting healthcare personnel from 2019-nCoV infection risks: lessons and suggestions,"作者:Zhang, ZR (Zhang, Zhiruo)[ 1 ] ; Liu, SL (Liu, Shelan)[ 2 ] ; Xiang, M (Xiang, Mi)[ 1 ] ; Li, SJ (Li, Shijian)[ 3 ] ; Zhao, DH (Zhao, Dahai)[ 4 ] ; Huang, CL (Huang, Chaolin)[ 5 ] ; Chen, SJ (Chen, Saijuan)[ 6 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,MAR 2020,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Ruijin Hosp, Natl Res Ctr Translat Med, Key Lab Med Genom,Shanghai Inst Hematol,Sch Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Starting around December 2019, an epidemic of pneumonia, which was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, broke out in Wuhan, China, and is spreading throughout the world. A new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was soon found to be the cause. At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation. In this study, we retrieved 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and GISAID databases, established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The homology among all viral strains was generally high, among them, 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the nucleotide level and 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level. Although overall variation in open-reading frame (ORF) regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95), respectively. These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. Establishment of the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.",作者关键词:homology; nucleotide; reference sequence; SARS-CoV-2; variation,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25762,The establishment of reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 and variation analysis,"作者:Wang, CT (Wang, Changtai)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Liu, ZP (Liu, Zhongping)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, ZX (Chen, Zixiang)[ 2 ] ; Huang, X (Huang, Xin)[ 2 ] ; Xu, MY (Xu, Mengyuan)[ 1,2 ] ; He, TF (He, Tengfei)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhang, ZH (Zhang, Zhenhua)[ 1,2,4 ]",研究方向:Virology,Emergency Science and Technology Plan for Novel Coronavirus Infection of Anqing ,出版年: JUN 2020,"Anhui Med Univ, Dept Infect Dis, Hosp 2, Furong Rd 678, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is again reminding us of the importance of using telehealth to deliver care, especially as means of reducing the risk of cross-contamination caused by close contact. For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care. Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the long-term, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.",作者关键词:Telehealth; telemedicine; pandemic; emergency; disaster management; sustainability; coronavirus; COVID-19,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE,1357633X20916567,Telehealth for global emergencies: Implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"作者:Smith, AC (Smith, Anthony C.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Thomas, E (Thomas, Emma)[ 1 ] ; Snoswell, CL (Snoswell, Centaine L.)[ 4 ] ; Haydon, H (Haydon, Helen)[ 1 ] ; Mehrotra, A (Mehrotra, Ateev)[ 5 ] ; Clemensen, J (Clemensen, Jane)[ 2,3 ] ; Caffery, LJ (Caffery, Liam J.)[ 1,4 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,10.1177/1357633X20916567,"Univ Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hosp, Ctr Online Hlth, Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Ground Level,Bldg 33, Woolloongabba, Qld 4102, Australia.

"摘要
Background: From the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began to spread in central China. Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China.

Methods: Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM).

Results: Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality.

Conclusion: During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.",作者关键词:Anxiety; Pneumonia; Sleep,文献类型:Article,MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,e923921,Social Capital and Sleep Quality in Individuals Who Self-Isolated for 14 Days During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in January 2020 in China,"作者:Xiao, H (Xiao, Han)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yan)[ 2 ] ; Kong, DS (Kong, Desheng)[ 2 ] ; Li, SY (Li, Shiyue)[ 3 ] ; Yang, NX (Yang, Ningxi)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,"Basic Research Project of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic of Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Harbin Engineering University ",出版年: MAR 20 2020,"Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.

"摘要
During a severe pandemic, especially one causing respiratory illness, many people may require mechanical ventilation. Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.",作者关键词:Public health preparedness; response; Ventilator; Allocation; Pandemic; COVID-19,文献类型:Article,HEALTH SECURITY,10.1089/hs.2020.0028,Strategies to Inform Allocation of Stockpiled Ventilators to Healthcare Facilities During a Pandemic,"作者:Koonin, LM (Koonin, Lisa M.)[ 1 ] ; Pillai, S (Pillai, Satish)[ 2 ] ; Kahn, EB (Kahn, Emily B.)[ 2 ] ; Moulia, D (Moulia, Danielle)[ 1 ] ; Patel, A (Patel, Anita)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,出版年: APR 1 2020,"Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, 100 Clifton Rd NE,Mailstop H24-8, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.

"摘要
Switzerland is among the countries with the highest number of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases per capita in the world. There are likely many people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease compatible with COVID-19.

"摘要
The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.",作者关键词:Emerging coronavirus; COVID-19; vaccines; therapeutics; drugs,文献类型:Review; Early Access,HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS,10.1080/21645515.2020.1735227,"COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics","作者:Dhama, K (Dhama, Kuldeep)[ 1 ] ; Sharun, K (Sharun, Khan)[ 2 ] ; Tiwari, R (Tiwari, Ruchi)[ 3 ] ; Dadar, M (Dadar, Maryam)[ 4 ] ; Malik, YS (Malik, Yashpal Singh)[ 5 ] ; Singh, KP (Singh, Karam Pal)[ 1 ] ; Chaicumpa, W (Chaicumpa, Wanpen)[ 6 ]",研究方向:Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,,MAR 2020,"ICAR Indian Vet Res Inst, Div Pathol, Bareilly 243122, Uttar Pradesh, India.

"摘要
As of 29 February 2020 there were 79,394 confirmed cases and 2,838 deaths from COVID-19 in mainland China. Of these, 48,557 cases and 2,169 deaths occurred in the epicenter, Wuhan. A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death. Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.9-2.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naive confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557 = 4.5%) and the approximator(1) of deaths/deaths + recoveries (2,169/2,169 + 17,572 = 11%) as of 29 February 2020. Compared to those aged 30-59 years, those aged below 30 and above 59 years were 0.6 (0.3-1.1) and 5.1 (4.2-6.1) times more likely to die after developing symptoms. The risk of symptomatic infection increased with age (for example, at similar to 4% per year among adults aged 30-60 years).",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,NATURE MEDICINE,10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7,"Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China","作者:Wu, JT (Wu, Joseph T.)[ 1 ] ; Leung, K (Leung, Kathy)[ 1 ] ; Bushman, M (Bushman, Mary)[ 2 ] ; Kishore, N (Kishore, Nishant)[ 2 ] ; Niehus, R (Niehus, Rene)[ 2 ] ; de Salazar, PM (de Salazar, Pablo M.)[ 2 ] ; Cowling, BJ (Cowling, Benjamin J.)[ 1 ] ; Lipsitch, M (Lipsitch, Marc)[ 2 ] ; Leung, GM (Leung, Gabriel M.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Health and Medical Research Fund from the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ,MAR 2020,"Univ Hong Kong, WHO Collaborating Ctr Infect Dis Epidemiol & Cont, Sch Publ Hlth, LKS Fac Med, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, first reported in Wuhan, China, has rapidly swept around the world just within a month, causing global public health emergency. In diagnosis, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations can supplement parts of limitations of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Based on a comprehensive literature review and the experience in the frontline, we aim to review the typical and relatively atypical CT manifestations with representative COVID-19 cases at our hospital, and hope to strengthen the recognition of these features with radiologists and help them make a quick and accurate diagnosis.

Background An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China. People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. Methods We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. Results The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-gamma (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. Conclusions In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.",作者关键词:Children; COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; Severe; Critical ill; Wuhan,文献类型:Article; Early Access,WORLD JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4,Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single center's observational study,"作者:Sun, D (Sun, Dan)[ 1,5 ] ; Li, H (Li, Hui)[ 2 ] ; Lu, XX (Lu, Xiao-Xia)[ 4 ] ; Xiao, H (Xiao, Han)[ 5 ] ; Ren, J (Ren, Jie)[ 3 ] ; Zhang, FR (Zhang, Fu-Rong)[ 3 ] ; Liu, ZS (Liu, Zhi-Sheng)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,,MAR 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan Childrens Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Neurol, Wuhan 430015, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.",作者关键词:2019 novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; spike protein; receptor-binding domain; viral inhibitor; cross-neutralization,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CELLULAR & MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY,10.1038/s41423-020-0400-4,Characterization of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of 2019 novel coronavirus: implication for development of RBD protein as a viral attachment inhibitor and vaccine,"作者:Tai, WB (Tai, Wanbo)[ 1 ] ; He, L (He, Lei)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, XJ (Zhang, Xiujuan)[ 1 ] ; Pu, J (Pu, Jing)[ 1,3 ] ; Voronin, D (Voronin, Denis)[ 1 ] ; Jiang, SB (Jiang, Shibo)[ 1,3 ] ; Zhou, YS (Zhou, Yusen)[ 2 ] ; Du, LY (Du, Lanying)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Immunology,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

"摘要
The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached Germany. The majority of people infected present with mild disease, but there are severe cases that need intensive care. Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung function. Diagnosis relies on PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract. Severe ARDS reflects the hallmark of a critical course of the disease. Preventing nosocomial infections (primarily by correct use of personal protective equipment) and maintenance of hospitals' operational capability are of utmost importance. Departments of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and emergency medicine will envisage major challenges.",作者关键词:Infectious disease outbreaks; Infection control; Emergency medicine; Anesthesiology; Intensive care,文献类型:Article,ANAESTHESIST,10.1007/s00101-020-00758-x,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): update for anesthesiologists and intensivists March 2020,"作者:Thomas-Rddel, D (Thomas-Rueddel, D.)[ 1,2 ] ; Winning, J (Winning, J.)[ 1 ] ; Dickmann, P (Dickmann, P.)[ 1,2 ] ; Ouart, D (Ouart, D.)[ 1,2 ] ; Kortgen, A (Kortgen, A.)[ 1 ] ; Janssens, U (Janssens, U.)[ 3 ] ; Bauer, M (Bauer, M.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology,,出版年: APR 2020,"Univ Klinikum Jena, Klin Anasthesiol & Intens Med, Klinikum 1, D-07747 Jena, Germany.

"摘要
Despite a growing body of evidence on the positive impact of sports science for golf, there is still a paucity of research investigating the ""perceptions"" and ""practices"" of high-skilled golfers. Professional Golfers' Association Assistant Professionals (future-qualified coaches; n = 430) were surveyed on their ""perceptions"" and ""practices"" of ""sports science"", ""warm-ups"", ""cool-downs"" and ""strength and conditioning"" for golf. Participants perceived the discipline of sports science as beneficial to golfers but lacked implementation in coaching settings. Warm-up protocols were also perceived to be beneficial to all aspects of golf performance; however, the duration of tournament-based (37.84 +/- 20.05 min), warm-ups was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than practice rounds (26.26 +/- 18.63 min) and range sessions (13.00 +/- 13.38 min). Education continues to be required to raise the understanding of warm-ups for golf. There were mixed perceptions regarding the benefits of a cool-down, with 62.1% of the high-skilled golfers omitting a cool-down following tournament play and practice. Strength and conditioning was perceived as beneficial, with 78.51% engaging in some form of training throughout the year. Results confirm, however, that certain misconceptions around surveyed sports science practices still exist and it is imperative that education disseminates research findings and validated applied practices to coaches and golfers alike.",作者关键词:PGA Professionals'; golf; warm-up; cool-down; strength and conditioning,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES,10.1080/02640414.2020.1737350,"Sports science for golf: A survey of high-skilled golfers' ""perceptions"" and ""practices""","作者:Wells, JET (Wells, Jack E.

"摘要
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and it has rapidly spread to almost all parts of the world. For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show antiviral activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol), and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one pi-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be a potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study.",作者关键词:RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; SARS-CoV-2; theaflavin; traditional Chinese medicinal compounds,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25761,The potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"作者:Lung, JH (Lung, Jrhau)[ 1 ] ; Lin, YS (Lin, Yu-Shih)[ 2 ] ; Yang, YH (Yang, Yao-Hsu)[ 3,4,5 ] ; Chou, YL (Chou, Yu-Lun)[ 6 ] ; Shu, LH (Shu, Li-Hsin)[ 3 ] ; Cheng, YC (Cheng, Yu-Ching)[ 3 ] ; Liu, HT (Liu, Hung Te)[ 3 ] ; Wu, CY (Wu, Ching-Yuan)[ 3,5 ]",研究方向:Virology,Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,出版年: JUN 2020,"Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Tradit Chinese Med, Chiayi Branch, Putzu 61363, Taiwan.

The corona virus (COVID-19) outbreak has spread from China to over a hundred countries in less than 2 months. Now is the time to take stock and to assess the responses of different countries to the outbreak so far.

"摘要
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Active learning; Cross-population train; test models; Multitudinal and multimodal data,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,93,AI-Driven Tools for Coronavirus Outbreak: Need of Active Learning and Cross-Population Train/Test Models on Multitudinal/Multimodal Data,"作者:Santosh, KC (Santosh, K.

Objective Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of infection. Methods The chest CT images of the patient were collected to describe the CT manifestations and characteristics, and they were compared with the previous studies. Results Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were seen in bilateral lung, mostly in subpleural areas. They progressed within 3 days, and nodular GGOs were also seen together with subpleural patchy GGOs. Conclusion Our case of COVID-19 pneumonia showed multiple subpleural GGOs in bilateral lung, rapid progression, and it also accompanied nodular GGOs on chest CT. These findings were consistent with the previous reports, and they might be useful for early detection and evaluation of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.",作者关键词:COVID-19 pneumonia; Ground-glass opacities; CT,文献类型:Article; Early Access,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s11604-020-00945-1,CT image of novel coronavirus pneumonia: a case report,"作者:Zhang, XM (Zhang, Xiangmin)[ 1,2 ] ; Song, W (Song, Wei)[ 1,2 ] ; Liu, XL (Liu, Xingli)[ 1,2 ] ; Lyu, L (Lyu, Liang)[ 1,2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,MAR 2020,"First Peoples Hosp Yunnan Prov, Dept Radiol, 157 Jinbi Rd, Kunming 650032, Yunnan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Methods A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. Results Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Conclusions There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Epidemiology; Causes; Prevention and control; Review,文献类型:Review,INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY,29,"Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review","作者:Adhikari, SP (Adhikari, Sasmita Poudel)[ 1,2 ] ; Meng, S (Meng, Sha)[ 1,2 ] ; Wu, YJ (Wu, Yu-Ju)[ 1,2 ] ; Mao, YP (Mao, Yu-Ping)[ 3 ] ; Ye, RX (Ye, Rui-Xue)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, QZ (Wang, Qing-Zhi)[ 1,2 ] ; Sun, C (Sun, Chang)[ 1,2 ] ; Sylvia, S (Sylvia, Sean)[ 4 ] ; Rozelle, S (Rozelle, Scott)[ 5 ] ; Raat, H (Raat, Hein)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,China Medical Board ,出版年: MAR 17 2020,"Sichuan Univ, West China Sch Publ Hlth, Chengdu, Peoples R China.

A novel viral respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in cases in China and worldwide. Four full-term, singleton infants were born to pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, where the disease was first identified. Of the three infants, for who consent to be diagnostically tested was provided, none tested positive for the virus. None of the infants developed serious clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or abnormal radiologic or hematologic evidence, and all four infants were alive at the time of hospital discharge. Two infants had rashes of unknown etiology at birth, and one had facial ulcerations. One infant had tachypnea and was supported by non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 3 days. One had rashes at birth but was discharged without parental consent for a diagnostic test. This case report describes the clinical course of four live born infants, born to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection.",作者关键词:newborns; clinical course; China; COVID-19 infected mothers; vertical transmission,文献类型:Article,FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS,104,Infants Born to Mothers With a New Coronavirus (COVID-19),"作者:Chen, Y (Chen, Yan)[ 1 ] ; Peng, H (Peng, Hua)[ 1 ] ; Wang, L (Wang, Lin)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, Y (Zhao, Yin)[ 2 ] ; Zeng, LK (Zeng, Lingkong)[ 3 ] ; Gao, H (Gao, Hui)[ 2 ] ; Liu, YL (Liu, Yalan)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: MAR 16 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Pediat, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In this article we propose a dynamical model with seven compartments to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in China. The home quarantine strategy has played a vital role in controlling the disease spread. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model is obtained. The control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed. Attention that the quarantine period must be long enough. Once the control strategy is removed, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human transmission continuously. In the study, a comprehensive meteorological index is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors. The effectiveness of vaccination is also considered in the model. We design detailed vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the effectiveness of large scale vaccination.",作者关键词:COVID-19; dynamical model; isolation strategy; vaccination strategy; meteorological index,文献类型:Article,ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS,23,MODELING THE CONTROL OF COVID-19: IMPACT OF POLICY INTERVENTIONS AND METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS,"作者:Jia, JW (Jia, Jiwei)[ 1,2 ] ; Ding, J (Ding, Jian)[ 1 ] ; Liu, SY (Liu, Siyu)[ 3 ] ; Liao, GD (Liao, Guidong)[ 1 ] ; Li, JZ (Li, Jingzhi)[ 4 ] ; Duan, B (Duan, Ben)[ 5 ] ; Wang, GQ (Wang, Guoqing)[ 6 ] ; Zhang, R (Zhang, Ran)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Mathematics,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: MAR 16 2020,"Jilin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Purpose To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting medical staff. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. Results The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. Conclusions Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.",,文献类型:Article; Early Access,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE,10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7,Safety and efficacy of different anesthetic regimens for parturients with COVID-19 undergoing Cesarean delivery: a case series of 17 patients,"作者:Chen, R (Chen, Rong)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yuan)[ 1,2 ] ; Huang, L (Huang, Lei)[ 2 ] ; Cheng, BH (Cheng, Bi-heng)[ 3 ] ; Xia, ZY (Xia, Zhong-yuan)[ 1,2 ] ; Meng, QT (Meng, Qing-tao)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology,,MAR 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Renmin Hosp, Wuhan 430060, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Since its emergence in December 2019, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted several countries, affecting more than 90 thousand patients and making it a global public threat. The routes of transmission are direct contact, and droplet and possible aerosol transmissions. Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission. Understanding the significance of aerosol transmission and its implications in dentistry can facilitate the identification and correction of negligence in daily dental practice. In addition to the standard precautions, some special precautions that should be implemented during an outbreak have been raised in this review.",作者关键词:Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Aerosol; Infection control; R780; 1; R511,文献类型:Review; Early Access,JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE B,10.1631/jzus.B2010010,Possible aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and special precautions in dentistry,"作者:Ge, ZY (Ge, Zi-yu)[ 1 ] ; Yang, LM (Yang, Lu-ming)[ 1 ] ; Xia, JJ (Xia, Jia-jia)[ 1 ] ; Fu, XH (Fu, Xiao-hui)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, YZ (Zhang, Yan-zhen)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province,MAR 2020,"Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Gen Dent, Hangzhou 310009, Peoples R China.

Background Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited. Methods To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory examination results of the children and their family members were described. Results The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them had normal chest CT images. After general and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly. Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province. Conclusions Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.",作者关键词:Children; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Wuhan,文献类型:Article; Early Access,WORLD JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2,Clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19: a report of two family cluster cases,"作者:Ji, LN (Ji, Li-Na)[ 1 ] ; Chao, S (Chao, Shuang)[ 1 ] ; Wang, YJ (Wang, Yue-Jiao)[ 1 ] ; Li, XJ (Li, Xue-Jun)[ 1 ] ; Mu, XD (Mu, Xiang-Dong)[ 2 ] ; Lin, MG (Lin, Ming-Gui)[ 3 ] ; Jiang, RM (Jiang, Rong-Meng)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,,MAR 2020,"Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hosp, Dept Pediat, Litang Rd 168, Beijing 102218, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China. This virus causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since then, there have been anecdotal reports of ocular infection. The ocular implications of human CoV infections have not been widely studied. However, CoVs have been known to cause various ocular infections in animals. Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline and murine models. In this article, the current evidence suggesting possible human CoV infection of ocular tissue is reviewed. The review article will also highlight animal CoVs and their associated ocular infections. We hope that this article will serve as a start for further research into the ocular implications of human CoV infections.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; novel coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2,文献类型:Review,OCULAR IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION,10.1080/09273948.2020.1738501,Can the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Affect the Eyes?

"摘要
Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.

Methods We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.

Findings Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively.

Interpretation Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

We report epidemiological and clinical investigations on ten pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection cases confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Symptoms in these cases were nonspecific and no children required respiratory support or intensive care. Chest X-rays lacked definite signs of pneumonia, a defining feature of the infection in adult cases. Notably, eight children persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, raising the possibility of fecal-oral transmission.

"摘要
An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.",作者关键词:Clinical characteristics; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Origin; SARS-CoV-2; Therapy; Transmission,文献类型:Review,MILITARY MEDICAL RESEARCH,11,"The origin, transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak - an update on the status","作者:Guo, YR (Guo, Yan-Rong)[ 1,2 ] ; Cao, QD (Cao, Qing-Dong)[ 3 ] ; Hong, ZS (Hong, Zhong-Si)[ 4 ] ; Tan, YY (Tan, Yuan-Yang)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, SD (Chen, Shou-Deng)[ 1,2 ] ; Jin, HJ (Jin, Hong-Jun)[ 1,2 ] ; Tan, KS (Tan, Kai-Sen)[ 5 ] ; Wang, DY (Wang, De-Yun)[ 5 ] ; Yan, Y (Yan, Yan)[ 1,2,6 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: MAR 13 2020,"Guangdong Prov Key Lab Biomed Imaging, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originating in Wuhan, China, has become a major public health challenge for not only China but also countries around the world. The World Health Organization announced that the outbreaks of the novel coronavirus have constituted a public health emergency of international concern. As of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 has been recognized in 34 countries, with a total of 80,239 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,700 deaths. Infection control measures are necessary to prevent the virus from further spreading and to help control the epidemic situation. Due to the characteristics of dental settings, the risk of cross infection can be high between patients and dental practitioners. For dental practices and hospitals in areas that are (potentially) affected with COVID-19, strict and effective infection control protocols are urgently needed. This article, based on our experience and relevant guidelines and research, introduces essential knowledge about COVID-19 and nosocomial infection in dental settings and provides recommended management protocols for dental practitioners and students in (potentially) affected areas.",作者关键词:virology; infection control; dental public health; dental education; transmission; dental practice management,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH,UNSP 0022034520914246,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Emerging and Future Challenges for Dental and Oral Medicine,"作者:Meng, L (Meng, L.)[ 1,2 ] ; Hua, F (Hua, F.)[ 3 ] ; Bian, Z (Bian, Z.)[ 1,2 ]","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: MAY 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Minist Educ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, State Key Lab Breeding Base Basic Sci Stomatol Hu, Luoyu Rd 237, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of Coronavirus has been spreading rapidly since its onset in Wuhan, the capital city of central China's Hubei Province, in December 2019. It is highly communicable through human-to-human transmission. China has been making unprecedented efforts in treating the confirmed cases, identifying and isolating their close contacts and suspected cases to control the source of infection and cut the route of transmission. China's devotion in handling this epidemic has effectively and efficiently curbed communication domestically and across the border. Representative measures adopted by Wenzhou, the worst hit city out of Hubei Province, are examined to elucidate those massive undertakings with the aim of enhancing international understanding and building global rapport in fighting this evolving epidemic situation.",作者关键词:COVID-19; novel coronavirus pneumonia; 2019-nCoV; epidemic management,文献类型:Editorial Material; Early Access,FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE,10.1007/s11684-020-0755-z,China's local governments are combating COVID-19 with unprecedented responses - from a Wenzhou governance perspective,"作者:Gong, FH (Gong, Fanghua)[ 1,2 ] ; Xiong, Y (Xiong, Yong)[ 2 ] ; Xiao, J (Xiao, Jian)[ 1,2 ] ; Lin, L (Lin, Li)[ 1,2 ] ; Liu, XD (Liu, Xiaodong)[ 3 ] ; Wang, DZ (Wang, Dezhong)[ 2 ] ; Li, XK (Li, Xiaokun)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,MAR 2020,"Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China.

On 5 February 2020, in Yokohama, Japan, a cruise ship hosting 3,711 people underwent a 2-week quarantine after a former passenger was found with COVID-19 post-disembarking. As at 20 February, 634 persons on board tested positive for the causative virus. We conducted statistical modelling to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of infections, along with the infections' timeline. The estimated asymptomatic proportion was 17.9% (95% credible interval (CrI): 15.5-20.2%). Most infections occurred before the quarantine start.",,文献类型:Article,EUROSURVEILLANCE,2000180,"Estimating the asymptomatic proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama, Japan, 2020","作者:Mizumoto, K (Mizumoto, Kenji)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Kagaya, K (Kagaya, Katsushi)[ 2,4 ] ; Zarebski, A (Zarebski, Alexander)[ 5 ] ; Chowell, G (Chowell, Gerardo)[ 3 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)

"摘要
Background Studies have reminded that cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities made patients more susceptible to suffer 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19), and exacerbated the infection. The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. Methods A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. Results A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. Conclusion Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.",作者关键词:COVID-19; 2019-nCoV; Cardiovascular metabolic diseases; Cardiac injury,文献类型:Review,CLINICAL RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY,10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9,Prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19 in China,"作者:Li, B (Li, Bo)[ 1 ] ; Yang, J (Yang, Jing)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhao, FM (Zhao, Faming)[ 3 ] ; Zhi, LL (Zhi, Lili)[ 4 ] ; Wang, XQ (Wang, Xiqian)[ 1 ] ; Liu, L (Liu, Lin)[ 1 ] ; Bi, ZH (Bi, Zhaohui)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, YH (Zhao, Yunhe)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: MAY 2020,"Shandong Univ, Zibo Cent Hosp, Dept Cardiol, 10 Sonth Shanghai Rd, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China.

"摘要
There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health threat. As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China. Overall, at the outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide information to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin containment activities.",作者关键词:China; coronavirus; COVID-19; data analysis; SARS-CoV-2; visualization,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25743,Analyzing the epidemiological outbreak of COVID-19: A visual exploratory data analysis approach,"作者:Dey, SK (Dey, Samrat K.)[ 1 ] ; Rahman, MM (Rahman, Md.

"摘要
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been designated a public health emergency of international concern. To prepare for a pandemic, hospitals need a strategy to manage their space, staff, and supplies so that optimum care is provided to patients. In addition, infection prevention measures need to be implemented to reduce in-hospital transmission. In the operating room, these preparations involve multiple stakeholders and can present a significant challenge. Here, we describe the outbreak response measures of the anesthetic department staffing the largest (1,700-bed) academic tertiary level acute care hospital in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital) and a smaller regional hospital (Sengkang General Hospital). These include engineering controls such as identification and preparation of an isolation operating room, administrative measures such as modification of workflow and processes, introduction of personal protective equipment for staff, and formulation of clinical guidelines for anesthetic management. Simulation was valuable in evaluating the feasibility of new operating room set-ups or workflow. We also discuss how the hierarchy of controls can be used as a framework to plan the necessary measures during each phase of a pandemic, and review the evidence for the measures taken. These containment measures are necessary to optimize the quality of care provided to COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of viral transmission to other patients or healthcare workers.",,文献类型:Review; Early Access,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE,10.1007/s12630-020-01620-9,Preparing for a COVID-19 pandemic: a review of operating room outbreak response measures in a large tertiary hospital in Singapore,"作者:Wong, J (Wong, Jolin)[ 1 ] ; Goh, QY (Goh, Qing Yuan)[ 1 ] ; Tan, ZH (Tan, Zihui)[ 1 ] ; Lie, SA (Lie, Sui An)[ 1 ] ; Tay, YC (Tay, Yoong Chuan)[ 1 ] ; Ng, SY (Ng, Shin Yi)[ 1 ] ; Soh, CR (Soh, Chai Rick)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology,,MAR 2020,"Singapore Gen Hosp, Div Anaesthesiol, Outram Rd, Singapore 169608, Singapore.

Background Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective To describe chest CT findings in children with COVID-19. Materials and methods We studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. Results We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. Conclusion Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.",作者关键词:Child; Computed tomography; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pneumonia; Viral,文献类型:Article; Early Access,PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7,Chest computed tomography in children with COVID-19 respiratory infection,"作者:Li, W (Li, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Cui, HQ (Cui, Huaqian)[ 2 ] ; Li, KW (Li, Kunwei)[ 1 ] ; Fang, YJ (Fang, Yijie)[ 1 ] ; Li, SL (Li, Shaolin)[ 1 ]","研究方向:Pediatrics; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,MAR 2020,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Biomed Imaging, Dept Radiol, Affiliated Hosp 5, 52 East Meihua Rd, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; GIS,文献类型:Editorial Material,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS,8,Geographical tracking and mapping of coronavirus disease COVID-19/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic and associated events around the world: how 21st century GIS technologies are supporting the global fight against outbreaks and epidemics,"作者:Boulos, MKN (Boulos, Maged N.)[ 1 ] ; Geraghty, EM (Geraghty, Estella M.)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,出版年: MAR 11 2020,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Informat Management, East Campus, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Background Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.

Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.

Findings All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1.0 x 10(9) cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.

Interpretation The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

"摘要
A healthy 35 year-old man who had visited Wuhan, China, presented with cough and fever that progressed to pneumonia. This report describes the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the condition. The case highlights the importance of close coordination between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels.

An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. We report the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the patient's initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness.

"摘要
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China.

Material/Methods: A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors.

Results: Levels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress. Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality.

Conclusions: SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and social support.","作者关键词:Anxiety; SARS Virus; Social Support; Stress, Psychological",文献类型:Article,MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,e923549,The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China,"作者:Xiao, H (Xiao, Han)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yan)[ 2 ] ; Kong, DS (Kong, Desheng)[ 2 ] ; Li, SY (Li, Shiyue)[ 3 ] ; Yang, NX (Yang, Ningxi)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,Basic Research Project of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic of Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Harbin Engineering University) ,出版年: MAR 5 2020,"Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.

"摘要
To solve various nonlinear problems in predicting safety distance, a prediction method for is proposed critical driving safety distance based on Particle Wwarm Optimization and Artificial Neural Network (PSO-ANN). PSO is used to optimize weight and threshold of ANN, which prevents ANN from easily falling into local optimum, and finds the global optimal solution through iteration. With road condition, the speed of the preceding vehicle, the speed of following vehicle, and the deceleration of preceding vehicle as input, critical driving safety distance as output, a prediction model with PSO-ANN is built. By training the collected sample data, the prediction result of driving safety distance is obtained, and compared with the prediction result of ANN is built. The experimental results show that the PSO-ANN algorithm is more stable and the average absolute error of prediction results is reduced by 7.8% compared with ANN method.

Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.",作者关键词:COVID-19; asymptomatic infections; close contact; China,文献类型:Article; Early Access,SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES,10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4,"Clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 screened among close contacts in Nanjing, China","作者:Hu, ZL (Hu, Zhiliang)[ 1,2 ] ; Song, C (Song, Ci)[ 2,3 ] ; Xu, CJ (Xu, Chuanjun)[ 4 ] ; Jin, GF (Jin, Guangfu)[ 2,3 ] ; Chen, YL (Chen, Yaling)[ 1 ] ; Xu, X (Xu, Xin)[ 2 ] ; Ma, HX (Ma, Hongxia)[ 2,3 ] ; Chen, W (Chen, Wei)[ 5 ] ; Lin, Y (Lin, Yuan)[ 6 ] ; Zheng, YS (Zheng, Yishan)[ 7 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,project of Jiangsu province medical youth talent ,MAR 2020,"Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Hosp Nanjing 2, Nanjing Infect Dis Ctr, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R China.

"摘要
An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.",作者关键词:2019-CoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; potential interventions; SARS,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25707,Potential interventions for novel coronavirus in China: A systematic review,"作者:Zhang, L (Zhang, Lei)[ 1 ] ; Liu, YH (Liu, Yunhui)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,"Key Laboratory of Neurooncology in Liaoning Province, China ",出版年: MAY 2020,"China Med Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Shengjing Hosp, 36 Sanhao St, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Purpose Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly emerged as a global health threat. The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients. Methods Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts. Results A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were suspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted. Conclusion We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Hong Kong; Infection control; Ophthalmology; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article,GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY,10.1007/s00417-020-04641-8,Stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology during the novel coronavirus outbreak: an experience from Hong Kong,"作者:Lai, THT (Lai, Tracy H.

"摘要
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, especially in East Asia. This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for the development of 2019-nCoV vaccines.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; epitope prediction; immunoinformatics; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25698,Immunoinformatics-aided identification of T cell and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV,"作者:Baruah, V (Baruah, Vargab)[ 1 ] ; Bose, S (Bose, Sujoy)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Virology,,出版年: MAY 2020,"Gauhati Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Gauhati 781014, Assam, India.

"摘要
Nowadays, sustainable development is considered a key concept and solution in creating a promising and prosperous future for human societies. Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 degrees C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases.",作者关键词:sustainable development; COVID-19; GMDH algorithm; binary classification; environmental factors,文献类型:Article,SUSTAINABILITY,2427,Investigating a Serious Challenge in the Sustainable Development Process: Analysis of Confirmed cases of COVID-19 (New Type of Coronavirus) Through a Binary Classification Using Artificial Intelligence and Regression Analysis,"作者:Pirouz, B (Pirouz, Behrouz)[ 1 ] ; Haghshenas, SS (Haghshenas, Sina Shaffiee)[ 2 ] ; Haghshenas, SS (Haghshenas, Sami Shaffiee)[ 2 ] ; Piro, P (Piro, Patrizia)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,出版年: MAR 2 2020,"Univ Calabria, Dept Civil Engn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.

"摘要
Prior to the Covid-19 global pandemic, we reviewed literature and identified comprehensive evidence of the efficacy of blended learning for pre-registration nursing students who learn across distances and/or via satellite campuses. Following a methodological framework, a scoping literature review was undertaken. We searched six databases (EBSCOHOST (CINHAL plus; Education research Complete; Australia/New Zealand Reference Centre); Google Scholar; EMBASE (Ovid) [ERIC (Ovid); Medline (Ovid)]; PubMed: ProQuest Education Journals & ProQuest Nursing & Allied Health Source) for the period 2005-December 2015. Critical appraisal for critiquing qualitative and quantitative studies was undertaken, as was a thematic analysis. Twenty-eight articles were included for review, which reported nursing research (n = 23) and student experiences of blended learning in higher education (n = 5). Four key themes were identified in the literature: active learning, technological barriers, support, and communication. The results suggest that when delivered purposefully, blended learning can positively influence and impact on the achievements of students, especially when utilised to manage and support distance education. Further research is needed about satellite campuses with student nurses, to assist with the development of future educational practice.",作者关键词:Blended learning; Pre-registration; Learning; Distance learning; Satellite campus; Literature review,文献类型:Review,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,UNSP 102775,Blended learning via distance in pre-registration nursing education: A scoping review,"作者:Jowsey, T (Jowsey, Tanisha)[ 1 ] ; Foster, G (Foster, Gail)[ 2 ] ; Cooper-Ioelu, P (Cooper-Ioelu, Pauline)[ 3 ] ; Jacobs, S (Jacobs, Stephen)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Nursing,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Univ Auckland, Ctr Med & Hlth Sci Educ, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.

"摘要
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002. The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2; SARS; MERS; COVID-19,文献类型:Review,PATHOGENS,186,Insights into the Recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Light of Past Human Coronavirus Outbreaks,"作者:Ashour, HM (Ashour, Hossam M.)[ 1,2 ] ; Elkhatib, WF (Elkhatib, Walid F.)[ 3,4 ] ; Rahman, MM (Rahman, Md.

"摘要
In December 2019, a cluster of fatal pneumonia cases presented in Wuhan, China. They were caused by a previously unknown coronavirus. All patients had been associated with the Wuhan Wholefood market, where seafood and live animals are sold. The virus spread rapidly and public health authorities in China initiated a containment effort. However, by that time, travelers had carried the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread media attention and panic. Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV). The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development. Here we present a summary of current knowledge regarding the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS; SARS-CoV-2; Wuhan; pandemic,文献类型:Review,PATHOGENS,231,SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus Disease 2019: What We Know So Far,"作者:Rabi, FA (Rabi, Firas A.)[ 1 ] ; Al Zoubi, MS (Al Zoubi, Mazhar S.)[ 2 ] ; Kasasbeh, GA (Kasasbeh, Ghena A.)[ 3 ] ; Salameh, DM (Salameh, Dunia M.)[ 3 ] ; Al-Nasser, AD (Al-Nasser, Amjad D.)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Microbiology,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Yarmouk Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Fac Med, Irbid 21163, Jordan.

"摘要
The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; 2019 novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; SARS-CoV; MERS-CoV; T cell epitopes; B cell epitopes; vaccine,文献类型:Article,VIRUSES-BASEL,254,Preliminary Identification of Potential Vaccine Targets for the COVID-19 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Based on SARS-CoV Immunological Studies,"作者:Ahmed, SF (Ahmed, Syed Faraz)[ 1 ] ; Quadeer, AA (Quadeer, Ahmed A.)[ 1 ] ; McKay, MR (McKay, Matthew R.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Virology,General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) ,出版年: MAR 2020,"Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of pneumonia caused by Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China. It was unfortunate that the outbreak has taken so many lives. It was partly because that the handling of the outbreak by the World Health Organization (hereinafter ""WHO"") was not timely or appropriate. There are so many positive and negative lessons we can learn from the outbreak. At the international level, WHO is supposed to lead the world to fight against the outbreak based on the International Health Regulations (2005) (hereinafter ""IHR (2005)'). However, it is apparent that there are many operational problems with the IHR (2005). The role of the IHR (2005) seems not to be critical in guiding States Parties for tackling the outbreak. The operation of the IHR (2005) can definitely be improved to make the system more capable of addressing life-threatening and life-saving issues. First, the compliance with the requirements of the IHR (2005) should be seriously addressed. Second, the independence of the Emergency Committee and that of the WHO Director-General should also be addressed so as to respect the desirable independence in performing their duties. Third, the transparency issue should also be addressed to help the country where the public health emergency of international concern (hereinafter ""PHEIC') occurs to faithfully respect the disclosure requirement and to become more transparent. Fourth, the timeliness and precautionary principle should be dealt with so as to require a timely decision of a PHEIC and to ensure that the precautionary principle plays a supplementary role to help the declaration of a PHEIC in a timely and efficient manner Fifth, WHO, its Director-General and States Parties of the IHR (2005) should also be expected to allow non-Parties' meaningful participation in the operation of the IHR (2005).",作者关键词:communicable disease; COVID-19; Emergency Committee; International Health Regulations 2005; IHR (2005); MERS; Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); SARS,文献类型:Article,ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY,MAR 2020,"THE MISSING OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE IHR (2005) FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF HANDLING THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19: PRECAUTION, INDEPENDENCE, TRANSPARENCY AND UNIVERSALITY","作者:Lo, CF (Lo, Chang-fa)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; International Relations; Government & Law,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Law, Taipei, Taiwan.

The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus or COVID-19(1)-outbreak has resuscitated global attention on the state of global health governance. Legal scholars and political scientists have long been fascinated by global governance of health, which had galvanized intellectual discourse that began almost two decades ago. Increasingly, global health operates in a complex, multipolar world, which is informed by pluralistic values. The ever-changing configuration of players, interests and values adds complexity to the global health landscape. It is timely to reexamine the landscape of global health, where new transnational challenges-such as galvanizing a global concerted effort towards international infectious disease control, financing global health activities in a sustainable manner, and achieving Universal Health Coverage - also inform new global health configuration. The article takes a historical view and traces the evolving of the global health landscape and examines the various of norms, processes and institutions that form global governance of health. The article also identifies the strengths and weakness of the International Health Regulations-the international legal architecture for international infectious disease control-as the novel coronavirus outbreak unfolds.",作者关键词:global governance of health; universal health coverage; World Health Organization; 2019 novel coronavirus; COVID-19; the right to health,文献类型:Article,ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY,MAR 2020,GLOBAL HEALTH IN A TURBULENCE TIME: A COMMENTARY,"作者:Lee, TL (Lee, Tsung-Ling)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; International Relations; Government & Law,Brocher Foundation ,出版年: MAR 2020,"Taipei Med Univ, Law, Taipei, Taiwan.

"摘要
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, was discovered in Wuhan, China, and has spread to different cities in China as well as to 24 other countries. The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination (<mml:semantics>R2</mml:semantics>), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances.",作者关键词:COVID-19; adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); forecasting; salp swarm algorithm (SSA); flower pollination algorithm (FPA),文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,10.3390/jcm9030674,Optimization Method for Forecasting Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in China,"作者:Al-qaness, MAA (Al-qaness, Mohammed A.

"摘要
The epicenter of the original outbreak in China has high male smoking rates of around 50%, and early reported death rates have an emphasis on older males, therefore the likelihood of smokers being overrepresented in fatalities is high. In Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea, female smoking rates are much lower than males. Fewer females have contracted the virus. If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid-19 because its male smoking rate is over 60% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses. Smoking can upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the human respiratory coronavirus NL638. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and ""heat-not-burn"" IQOS devices. ACE2 could be a novel adhesion molecule for SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation. Data on smoking status should be collected on all identified cases of Covid-19.",作者关键词:ACE2 receptor; SARS-CoV-2; Covid-19; Smoking; COPD; Electronic cigarettes; Vaping; Heat-Not-Burn; IQOS,文献类型:Editorial Material,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,841,Smoking Upregulates Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 Receptor: A Potential Adhesion Site for Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19),"作者:Brake, SJ (Brake, Samuel James)[ 1 ] ; Barnsley, K (Barnsley, Kathryn)[ 2 ] ; Lu, WY (Lu, Wenying)[ 1 ] ; McAlinden, KD (McAlinden, Kielan Darcy)[ 1 ] ; Eapen, MS (Eapen, Mathew Suji)[ 1 ] ; Sohal, SS (Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Univ Tasmania, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Lab Med, Resp Translat Res Grp, Launceston, Tas 7248, Australia.

The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan was reported on 15 January 2020 and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. The purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan by using the real-time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020. Taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population, we apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction. By using a least-square-based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is <mml:semantics>R0=2.6</mml:semantics> (<mml:semantics>95%</mml:semantics>CI, <mml:semantics>2.4</mml:semantics>-<mml:semantics>2.8</mml:semantics>) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer. In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SEIR compartmental model; basic reproduction number,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,10.3390/jcm9030789,"Prediction of the Epidemic Peak of Coronavirus Disease in Japan, 2020","作者:Kuniya, T (Kuniya, Toshikazu)[ 1 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)

"摘要
To understand the time-dependent risk of infection on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, I estimated the incidence of infection with novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited.

"摘要
Recently, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a respiratory infection with significant concern for global public health hazards. With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases arc being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-l9 to as minimum as possible. Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic. Herein, we aim to discuss the latest updates on the origin, genomic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment options and current efforts being made by international health organizations with regards to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.",作者关键词:Respiratory disease; viral infection; coronavirus; World Health Organization; quarantine period,文献类型:Review,ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,393,Comprehensive update on current outbreak of novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV),"作者:Sahu, KK (Sahu, Kamal Kant)[ 1 ] ; Mishra, AK (Mishra, Ajay Kumar)[ 1 ] ; Lal, A (Lal, Amos)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Mayo Clin, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.

Fast point-of-use detection of, for example, early-stage zoonoses, e.g., Q-fever, bovine tuberculosis, or the Covid-19 coronavirus, is beneficial for both humans and animal husbandry as it can save lives and livestock. The latter prevents farmers from going bankrupt after a zoonoses outbreak. This paper describes the development of a fabrication process and the proof-of-principle of a disposable DNA amplification chip with an integrated heater. Based on the analysis of the milling process, metal adhesion studies, and COMSOL MultiPhysics heat transfer simulations, the first batch of chips has been fabricated and successful multiple displacement amplification reactions are performed inside these chips. This research is the first step towards the development of an early-stage zoonoses detection device. Tests with real zoonoses and DNA specific amplification reactions still need to be done.",作者关键词:early-stage disease detection; multiple displacement amplification; on-chip DNA amplification; integrated heaters; cyclic olefin copolymer; polymer-based disposable microfluidic chips; zoonoses,文献类型:Article; Proceedings Paper,MICROMACHINES,238,Disposable DNA Amplification Chips with Integrated Low-Cost Heaters dagger,"作者:Veltkamp, HW (Veltkamp, Henk-Willem)[ 1 ] ; Monteiro, FA (Monteiro, Fernanda Akegawa)[ 1 ] ; Sanders, R (Sanders, Remco)[ 1 ] ; Wiegerink, R (Wiegerink, Remco)[ 1 ] ; Lotters, J (Lotters, Joost)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Univ Twente, Dept Integrated Devices & Syst, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

Three zoonotic coronaviruses emerged at the beginning of the XXI century: SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), the etiologic agent of COVID 19 (Coronavirus disease) pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and has spread extremely fast worldwide. The World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

"摘要
In early March 2020, the March-April Hastings Center Report was very nearly assembled and contained nothing about Covid-19, which was still just beginning to make itself publicly known in the United States. Two weeks later, the editorial line-up was undergoing a remix, and essays that lay out sweeping agendas for the response to the worldwide crisis were in preparation. The central theme in the agenda that Lawrence O. Gostin and colleagues develop is that the pandemic requires a sharp break from usual ethical norms yet simultaneously demands a return to core ethical commitments. A similar theme is sounded by Mildred Z. Solomon and colleagues in a commentary calling for federal actions to keep the health care system functioning. Other essays in the issue take up an assortment of topical issues-including international patient dumping-that were simmering along prior to the pandemic, and the two articles take up foundational questions about the nature of moral reasoning.",作者关键词:Covid-19; novel coronavirus pandemic; public health ethics; moral reasoning; reasonable person standard,文献类型:Editorial Material,HASTINGS CENTER REPORT,10.1002/hast.1092,All People,"作者:Kaebnick, G (Kaebnick, Greg)",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Ethics; Biomedical Social Sciences,,出版年: MAR 2020,
"摘要
As we write, U.S. cities and states with extensive community transmission of Covid-19 are in harm's way-not only because of the disease itself but also because of prior and current failures to act. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, public health agencies and hospitals developed but never adequately implemented preparedness plans. Focused on efficiency in a competitive market, health systems had few incentives to maintain stockpiles of essential medical equipment. Just-in-time economic models resulted in storage of only those supplies needed then. At the same time, global purchasing in search of lower prices reduced the number of U.S. suppliers, with hospitals dependent on foreign companies. There is still a possibility that the pandemic will be manageably bad rather than unmanageably catastrophic in this country. Immediate, powerful, and sustained federal action could make the difference.",作者关键词:novel coronavirus; Covid-19; pandemic; US federal government; Defense Production Act; public health emergency; allocation of scarce resources,文献类型:Editorial Material,HASTINGS CENTER REPORT,10.1002/hast.1093,Scarcity in the Covid-19 Pandemic,"作者:Solomon, MZ (Solomon, Mildred Z.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Wynia, M (Wynia, Matthew)[ 1,4 ] ; Gostin, LO (Gostin, Lawrence O.)[ 5,6 ]",研究方向:Social Sciences - Other Topics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Ethics; Biomedical Social Sciences,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Hastings Ctr, Garrison, NY 10524 USA.

Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.",作者关键词:anxiety; coronavirus; depression; epidemic; knowledge; precaution; psychological impact; respiratory symptoms; stress,文献类型:Article,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,1729,Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China,"作者:Wang, CY (Wang, Cuiyan)[ 1 ] ; Pan, RY (Pan, Riyu)[ 1 ] ; Wan, XY (Wan, Xiaoyang)[ 1 ] ; Tan, YL (Tan, Yilin)[ 1 ] ; Xu, LK (Xu, Linkang)[ 1 ] ; Ho, CS (Ho, Cyrus S.)[ 2,3 ] ; Ho, RC (Ho, Roger C.)[ 1,3,4 ]","研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,出版年: MAR 2020,"Huaibei Normal Univ, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Fac Educ, Huaibei 235000, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak of an epidemic disease may pose significant treats to human beings and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution.",作者关键词:epidemic outbreak; medical waste; reverse logistics; epidemic logistics; network design; operations research,文献类型:Article,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,1770,Reverse Logistics Network Design for Effective Management of Medical Waste in Epidemic Outbreaks: Insights from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in Wuhan (China),"作者:Yu, H (Yu, Hao)[ 1 ] ; Sun, X (Sun, Xu)[ 1 ] ; Solvang, WD (Solvang, Wei Deng)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, X (Zhao, Xu)[ 2 ]","研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",UiT The Arctic University of Norway ,出版年: MAR 2020,"UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Ind Engn, Lodve Langesgate 2, N-8514 Narvik, Norway.

"摘要
Beginning in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to 2019-nCoV infection, emerged in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China and even worldwide. Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/ threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, ox- idative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.",作者关键词:COVID-19; 2019 n-CoV; Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction; Traditional Chinese medicine; Integrating network pharmacology,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,Utilizing integrating network pharmacological approaches to investigate the potential mechanism of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction in treating COVID-19,"作者:Wang, YX (Wang, Y-X)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ma, JR (Ma, J-R)[ 4 ] ; Wang, SQ (Wang, S-Q)[ 5 ] ; Zeng, YQ (Zeng, Y-Q)[ 6 ] ; Zhou, CY (Zhou, C-Y)[ 5 ] ; Ru, YH (Ru, Y-H)[ 7 ] ; Zhang, L (Zhang, L.)[ 1 ] ; Lu, ZG (Lu, Z-G)[ 2 ] ; Wu, MH (Wu, M-H)[ 1 ] ; Li, H (Li, H.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,National Natural Science Foundation of China,出版年: MAR 2020,"Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Jiangsu Prov Hosp Chinese Med, Dept Neurol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has been prevalent in Wuhan, China, and has been rapidly spreading to mainland China. Currently, more than 80,000 people have been infected, of which over 10,000 were severely ill and had characteristics of dyspnea and hypoxemia about one week after onset. Severe patients had rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing multiple organ failures and even death, with a mortality rate of nearly 4.3%. The treatment of severe COVID-19 patients has been rarely reported. This study reported a successful example of a severe COVID-19 patient with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) technology in our hospital. This experience revealed that the early application of ECMO can dramatically promote the recovery of severe COVID-19 patients.",作者关键词:Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; COVID-19; Dyspnea; Hypoxemia; Acute respiratory distress syndrome,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,"Successful treatment of COVID-19 using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a case report","作者:Zhan, WQ (Zhan, W-Q)[ 1 ] ; Li, MD (Li, M-D)[ 1 ] ; Xu, M (Xu, M.)[ 1 ] ; Lu, YB (Lu, Y-B)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Xinyang Cent Hosp, Dept Crit Care Med, Xinyang City, Henan, Peoples R China.

OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which outbroke in December 2019 is highly contagious with a low cure rate. In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared.

RESULTS: Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group.

CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.",作者关键词:Clinical trial; Coronavirus; Lopinavir/ritonavir; COVID-19; China,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,Clinical efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019,"作者:Ye, XT (Ye, X-T)[ 1 ] ; Luo, YL (Luo, Y-L)[ 1 ] ; Xia, SC (Xia, S-C)[ 2 ] ; Sun, QF (Sun, Q-F)[ 1 ] ; Ding, JG (Ding, J-G)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, Y (Zhou, Y.)[ 1 ] ; Chen, W (Chen, W.)[ 1 ] ; Wang, XF (Wang, X-F)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, WW (Zhang, W-W)[ 1 ] ; Du, WJ (Du, W-J)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation: experimental study on the role of IL-6-INDUCED exosome pathway in promoting invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by omitting microRNA-133a-3p ,出版年: MAR 2020,"Ruian Peoples Hosp, Dept Infect, Ruian, Peoples R China.

"摘要
On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. As of February 29, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has reported 79,389 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 34 provinces. The masks can be used to block respiratory transmission from human to human, and are an effective way to control influenza. It is, therefore, necessary to wear a mask when respiratory infectious diseases are prevalent. China has a population of 1.4 billion. Assuming that two-thirds of the people in China must wear a mask every day, the daily demand for masks will reach 900 million. The Chinese government has taken many measures to solve these problems. Additionally, more measures should be taken to properly dispose of mask garbage. Although the outbreak originated in China, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed, which means that it can be spread to anywhere in the world if prevention measures fail. The issues regarding face mask shortages and garbage in China, therefore, deserve worldwide attention.",作者关键词:Mask; Crisis; COVID-19 outbreak; SARS-CoV-2,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,Mask crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak,"作者:Wang, MW (Wang, M-W)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, MY (Zhou, M-Y)[ 2 ] ; Ji, GH (Ji, G-H)[ 1 ] ; Ye, L (Ye, L.)[ 4 ] ; Cheng, YR (Cheng, Y-R)[ 2,3 ] ; Feng, ZH (Feng, Z-H)[ 5 ] ; Chen, J (Chen, J.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Hangzhou Normal Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus COVID-19 further transmitted to several countries globally. The status of the infected cases can be determined basing on the treatment process along with several other factors. This research aims to build a classifier prediction model to predict the status of recovered and death coronavirus CovID-19 patients in South Korea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Artificial neural network principle is used to classify the collected data between February 20, 2020 and March 9, 2020. The proposed classifier used different seven variables, namely, country, infection reason, sex, group, confirmation date, birth year, and region. The most effective variables on recovered and fatal cases are analyzed based on the neural network model.

RESULTS: The results found that the proposed predictive classifier efficiently predicted recovered and death cases. Besides, it is found that discovering the infection reason would increase the probability to recover the patient. This indicates that the virus might be controllable based on infection reasons. In addition, the earlier discovery of the disease affords better control and a higher probability of being recovered.

CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendation is to use this model to predict the status of the patients globally.",作者关键词:Epidemiology; Engineering and technology; Infection; South Korea,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,A classifier prediction model to predict the status of Coronavirus CoVID-19 patients in South Korea,"作者:Al-Najjar, H (Al-Najjar, H.)[ 1 ] ; Al-Rousan, N (Al-Rousan, N.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus-infected pneumonia broke out in Wuhan and spread rapidly to other parts of the country. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the confirmed cases of COVID-19, who were admitted to the North Hospital of Changsha first Hospital (Changsha Public Health treatment Center) from January 17 to February 7, 2020.

RESULTS: The median age of COVID-19 patients was 45 years (range 33.5-57). The male patients accounted for 49.7%, 64.6% of the patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan, and 31.7% had family aggregation. The median days of onset were six, and the incidence of severe illness was 18.6%. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in older age, hypertension, bilateral lung plaque shadow, decrease in lymphocyte count, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase.

CONCLUSIONS: Age, combined hypertension, oxygenation index, double lung patch, decreased lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase can be used as predictors of the disease severity.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Pneumonia; Clinical features; Disease severity,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,Clinical characteristics of 161 cases of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Changsha,"作者:Zheng, F (Zheng, F.)[ 1 ] ; Tang, W (Tang, W.)[ 1 ] ; Li, H (Li, H.)[ 2 ] ; Huang, YX (Huang, Y-X)[ 1 ] ; Xie, YL (Xie, Y-L)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, ZG (Zhou, Z-G)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Innovative Major Emergency Project Funding against the New Coronavirus Pneumonia in Hunan Province ,出版年: MAR 2020,"First Hosp Changsha, Dept Infect Dis, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. COVID-19 is predominantly considered as an unavoidable pandemic, and scientists are very curious about how to provide the best protection to the public before a vaccine can be made available. There is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes. Hence, we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber-based respiratory masks. Our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three-layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation. These masks will be beneficial not just to healthcare workers but common citizens as well. In the absence of vaccination, productive masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases.",作者关键词:COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019); Medicinal plant; Respiratory mask; Protective measures,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,COVID-19: emerging protective measures,"作者:Balachandar, V (Balachandar, V)[ 1 ] ; Mahalaxmi, I (Mahalaxmi, I)[ 2 ] ; Kaavya, J (Kaavya, J.)[ 2 ] ; Vivekanandhan, G (Vivekanandhan, G.)[ 3 ] ; Ajithkumar, S (Ajithkumar, S.)[ 4 ] ; Arul, N (Arul, N.)[ 5 ] ; Singaravelu, G (Singaravelu, G.)[ 6 ] ; Kumar, NS (Kumar, N.

The outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) poses serious challenges to people's health worldwide. The management of the disease is mostly supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in a significant proportion of affected patients. Preliminary data point out that dramatic increase in IL-6 and subsequent cytokine release syndrome may account for the development of fatal interstitial pneumonia. Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects. It is tempting to speculate that inositol could be beneficial in managing the most dreadful effects of Sars-CoV-2 infection.",作者关键词:Sars-CoV-2; COVID-19; Myo-Inositol; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Interleukin-6 (IL-6),文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,MAR 2020,Inositol and pulmonary function.

"摘要
Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan. These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.",作者关键词:Wuhan pneumonia; coronavirus; CoV; severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS; COVID-19; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ACE2; SARS-CoV; 2019-nCoV; outbreak; epidemic; epidemiology; infection; drought; bat; green light; red light; wildlife; host; exposure; risk,文献类型:Review,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,1633,Potential Factors Influencing Repeated SARS Outbreaks in China,"作者:Sun, Z (Sun, Zhong)[ 1 ] ; Thilakavathy, K (Thilakavathy, Karuppiah)[ 1,2 ] ; Kumar, SS (Kumar, S.

As the world is witnessing the epidemic of COVID- 19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerging genetics and clinical evidences suggest a similar path to those of SARS and MERS. The rapid genomic sequencing and open access data, together with advanced vaccine technology, are expected to give us more knowledge on the pathogen itself, including the host immune response as well as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future. This review aims to provide a comparative view among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly epidemic SARS-CoV-2, in the hope to gain a better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasion strategies. This predictive view may help in designing an immune intervention or preventive vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; immune response; COVID-19; immune evasion; immunopathology,文献类型:Review,ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY,10.12932/AP-200220-0772,Immune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: Lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic,"作者:Prompetchara, E (Prompetchara, Eakachai)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Kettoy, C (Kettoy, Chutitorn)[ 1,2 ] ; Palaga, T (Palaga, Tanapat)[ 4,5 ]",研究方向:Allergy; Immunology,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Microbiol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.

Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21"" century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Emerging threat; Monoclonal Antibody; Immunotherapy; Infectious diseases; Viruses; Zoonoses,文献类型:Review,ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY,10.12932/AP-200220-0773,Perspectives on monoclonal antibody therapy as potential therapeutic intervention for Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19),"作者:Shanmugaraj, B (Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan)[ 1,2 ] ; Siriwattananon, K (Siriwattananon, Konlavat)[ 1,2 ] ; Wangkanont, K (Wangkanont, Kittikhun)[ 3 ] ; Phoolcharoen, W (Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Allergy; Immunology,"Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University ",出版年: MAR 2020,"Chulalongkorn Univ, Res Unit Plant Produced Pharmaceut, Bangkok, Thailand.

In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid development of highly specific diagnostics.

"摘要
Currently, the outbreak of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading especially in Wuhan city, and threatens 14 million people in central China. In the present study we applied the Moran index, a strong statistical tool, to the spatial panel to show that COVID-19 infection is spatially dependent and mainly spread from Hubei Province in Central China to neighbouring areas. Logistic model was employed according to the trend of available data, which shows the difference between Hubei Province and outside of it. We also calculated the reproduction number R0 for the range of [2.23, 2.51] via SEIR model. The measures to reduce or prevent the virus spread should be implemented, and we expect our datadriven modeling analysis providing some insights to identify and prepare for the future virus control.",作者关键词:COVID-19; spatial-temporal distribution; logistic model; SEIR,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,10.3855/jidc.12585,Spatial-temporal distribution of COVID-19 in China and its prediction: A data-driven modeling analysis,"作者:Huang, R (Huang, Rui)[ 1 ] ; Liu, M (Liu, Miao)[ 2 ] ; Ding, YM (Ding, Yongmei)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

"摘要
18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called SARS-CoV, from the Guangdong Province of southern China. After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

"摘要
COVID-19 case fatalities surged during the month of March 2020 in Italy, reaching over 10,000 by 28 March 2020. This number exceeds the number of fatalities in China (3,301) recorded from January to March, even though the number of diagnosed cases was similar (85,000 Italy vs. 80,000 China). Case Fatality Rates (CFR) could be somewhat unreliable because the estimation of total case numbers is limited by several factors, including insufficient testing and limitations in test kits and materials, such as NP swabs and PPE for testers. Sero prevalence of SARSCoV-2 antibodies may help in more accurate estimations of the total number of cases. Nevertheless, the disparity in the differences in the total number of fatalities between Italy and China suggests that investigation into several factors, such as demographics, sociological interactions, availability of medical equipment (ICU beds and PPE), variants in immune proteins (e.g., HLA, IFNs), past immunity to related CoVs, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2, could impact survival of severe COVID-19 illness survival and the number of case fatalities.",作者关键词:novel coronavirus; COVID-19; Italy; Case Fatality Rates; SARS-CoV-19; immunity,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,10.3855/jidc.12734,"As COVID-19 cases, deaths and fatality rates surge in Italy, underlying causes require investigation","作者:Rubino, S (Rubino, Salvatore)[ 1 ] ; Kelvin, N (Kelvin, Nikki)[ 2 ] ; Bermejo-Martin, JF (Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F.)[ 3,4 ] ; Kelvin, DJ (Kelvin, David J.)[ 2,5,6 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,"Li-Ka Shing Foundation, Shantou University Medical College ",出版年: MAR 2020,"Dalhousie Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, 5850 Coll St,Tupper 7C, Halifax, NS, Canada.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective. In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Here, we review the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; outbreak,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,10.4014/jmb.2003.03011,"Current Status of Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Therapeutics, and Vaccines for Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","作者:Ahn, DG (Ahn, Dae-Gyun)[ 1 ] ; Shin, HJ (Shin, Hye-Jin)[ 1 ] ; Kim, MH (Kim, Mi-Hwa)[ 1,2 ] ; Lee, S (Lee, Sunhee)[ 1 ] ; Kim, HS (Kim, Hae-Soo)[ 1 ] ; Myoung, J (Myoung, Jinjong)[ 3,4 ] ; Kim, BT (Kim, Bum-Tae)[ 1 ] ; Kim, SJ (Kim, Seong-Jun)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology,National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) grant through the Korean government (MSIP) ,出版年: MAR 2020,"Korea Res Inst Chem Technol, Ctr Convergent Res Emerging Virus Infect, Daejeon 34114, South Korea.

Background: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in China was caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the screening and diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital.

Methods: Developed a procedure for the identification of children cases with COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency department of our hospital, then we observed how this process works.

Results: (I) There were 56 cases considered suspected cases, and 10 cases were confirmed as COVID-19. (II) Of the 10 confirmed COVID)-19 cases admitted in our hospital, 5 were males and 5 were females, aged from 7 months to 11 years, the average age is 6.0 +/- 4.2 years, 6 cases were mild pneumonia, the others were upper respiratory tract infection. (III) We followed up 68 patients in isolation at home until symptoms disappeared. Non were missed in the patient's first visit. The sensitivity of this method is 100% and the specificity is 71.3%.

"摘要
Background UW Medicine was one of the first health systems to encounter and treat COVID-19 patients in the United States, starting in late February 2020.

Objective Here we describe the rapid rollout of capabilities by UW Medicine Information Technology Services (ITS) to support our clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide recommendations for health systems to urgently consider, as they plan their own response to this and potentially other future pandemics.

Methods Our recommendations include establishing a hospital incident command structure that includes tight integration with IT, creating automated dashboards for incident command, optimizing emergency communication to staff and patients, and preparing human resources, security, other policies, and equipment to support the transition of all nonessential staff to telework. We describe how UW Medicine quickly expanded telemedicine capabilities to include most primary care providers and increasing numbers of specialty providers. We look at how we managed expedited change control processes to quickly update electronic health records (EHR) with new COVID-19 laboratory and clinical workflows. We also examine the integration of new technology such as tele-intensive care (ICU) equipment and improved integration with teleconferencing software into our EHR. To support the rapid preparation for COVID-19 at other health systems, we include samples of the UW Medicine's COVID-19 order set, COVID-19 documentation template, dashboard metric categories, and a list of the top 10 things your health care IT organization can do now to prepare.

Conclusion The COVID-19 response requires new and expedited ways of approaching ITS support to clinical needs. UW Medicine ITS leadership hope that by quickly sharing our nimble response to clinical and operational requests, we can help other systems prepare to respond to this public health emergency.",作者关键词:COVID-19; health information technology; public health,文献类型:Article,APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS,10.1055/s-0040-1709715,Responding to COVID-19: The UW Medicine Information Technology Services Experience,"作者:Grange, ES (Grange, Elisha S.)[ 1 ] ; Neil, EJ (Neil, Eric J.)[ 1 ] ; Stoffel, M (Stoffel, Michelle)[ 2,3 ] ; Singh, AP (Singh, Angad P.)[ 1,4 ] ; Tseng, E (Tseng, Ethan)[ 3,5 ] ; Resco-Summers, K (Resco-Summers, Kelly)[ 1 ] ; Fellner, BJ (Fellner, B.

"摘要
As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in 'lockdown' directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation's economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.",作者关键词:urban health; smart cities; artificial intelligence; Coronavirus; pandemics; future cities; Internet of Things (IoT); COVID-19; 2019-nCoV,文献类型:Article,HEALTHCARE,46,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"作者:Allam, Z (Allam, Zaheer)[ 1 ] ; Jones, DS (Jones, David S.)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,,出版年: MAR 2020,"PLDI, Port Louis 11302, Mauritius.

Risk communication is critical to emergency management. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the effective process and attention points of risk communication reflecting on the COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China. We provide the timeline of risk communication progress in Wuhan and use a message-centered approach to identify problems that it entailed. It was found that the delayed decision making of the local government officials and the limited information disclosure should be mainly responsible for the ineffective risk communication. The principles for effective risk communication concerning Wuhan's outbreak management were also discussed. The whole communication process is suggested to integrate the accessibility and openness of risk information, the timing and frequency of communication, and the strategies dealing with uncertainties. Based on these principles and lessons from Wuhan's case, this paper employed a simplified Government-Expert-Public risk communication model to illustrate a collaborative network for effective risk communication.",作者关键词:risk communication; public health; outbreak management; COVID-19,文献类型:Article,HEALTHCARE,64,"Effective Risk Communication for Public Health Emergency: Reflection on the COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Outbreak in Wuhan, China","作者:Zhang, LW (Zhang, Liwei)[ 1 ] ; Li, HJ (Li, Huijie)[ 1 ] ; Chen, KL (Chen, Kelin)[ 2 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,National Social Science Fund Youth Program ,出版年: MAR 2020,"Jilin Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.

"摘要
In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; Outbreak; Pneumonia; Zoonosis,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000270,The outbreak of COVID-19: An overview,"作者:Wu, YC (Wu, Yi-Chi)[ 1 ] ; Chen, CS (Chen, Ching-Sung)[ 1 ] ; Chan, YJ (Chan, Yu-Jiun)[ 1,2,3 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Taipei Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Div Microbiol, 201,Sect 2,Shi Pai Rd, Taipei 112, Taiwan.

The COVID-19 coronavirus is currently spreading around the globe with limited treatment options available. This article presents the rationale for potentially using old drugs (emetine, other ipecac alkaloids or analogues) that have been used to treat amoebiasis in the treatment of COVID-19. Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. While EC50 concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC(50)s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.",作者关键词:COVID-19; coronavirus; emetine; ipecac; dehydroemetine; MERS; SARS; treatment; repurposing; antiviral,文献类型:Editorial Material,PHARMACEUTICALS,51,"Emetine, Ipecac, Ipecac Alkaloids and Analogues as Potential Antiviral Agents for Coronaviruses","作者:Bleasel, MD (Bleasel, Martin D.)[ 1 ] ; Peterson, GM (Peterson, Gregory M.)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Univ Tasmania, Sch Pharm & Pharmacol, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.

Context: Within only 30 days after the first announcement of infection with ""SARS-CoV-2"" in Wuhan, it spread to more than 20 countries and become a pandemic by WHO as a ""high alarming level of infection"" with 136,343 involved cases all over the world.

Methods: To uncover more about the probable gastrointestinal transmission and its clinical manifestations, we reviewed all research publications with keywords including: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus"", ""outbreak"", ""ARAS-CoV"" in Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar as well as all news in social media about ""novel COVID-19 pandemic"". Out of 40 recent publications,10 articles were studied by 2 authors.

Results: Although the SARS-CoV-2 tends to infect respiratory epithelial cells through the respiratory tracts, recent investigations detected the virus in the stool specimen, raising the question of the fecal-oral transmission route. Different studies showed that almost all gastrointestinal signs and symptoms were seen in elderly patients (more than 65 years old). including anorexia (40%), nonspecific abdominal pains (8%), diarrhea (10%) and nausea and Vomiting in about 8% of patients. Anorexia and generalized abdominal pain suffer many treated cases even10 - 20 days after negative blood tests (like CRP, lymphopenia) and negative PCR of respiratory samples. The main reason for this prolonged anorexia and abdominal pain may be due to the long persistence of COVID-19 in the gastrointestinal tracts after primary treatment.

Conclusions: Comparing to SARS, patients with COVID-19 showed less diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort before respiratory symptoms. Feces as a potential contagious source of Viral RNA can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. We strongly recommend all cured patients of COVID-19 to disinfect and clean their toilets until17- 20 days after negative blood tests and solving their respiratory disorders. Gastrointestinal manifestations have seen in all men while no women referred with GI signs.",作者关键词:COVID-19; Corona; Outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; Gastrointestinal,文献类型:Review,HEPATITIS MONTHLY,e102729,Panic of Buying Toilet Papers: A Historical Memory or a Horrible Truth?

"摘要
Background: The novel coronavirus named COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan, China, has spread to many countries around the world. Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to combat this disease. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have unique roles in the treatment of viral infections. In this article we analyzed the effectiveness and possible molecular mechanisms of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19.

Methods: The active ingredients and action targets of CHM formulas were obtained from the TCMSP database. Genes related to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were queried on the GeneCards database. The action mechanisms of these genes were predicted using a Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional enrichment and annotation tool and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

Results: CHM formulas played a positive role in preventing COVID-19 and warrant further application.

Conclusions: Our research provides new evidence to support the possible value of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19. However, further clinical studies with large sample sizes are required to verify their effectiveness.",作者关键词:Novel coronavirus; COVID-19; traditional Chinese herbal medicines (traditional CHM); network pharmacology,文献类型:Article,ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE,10.21037/apm.2020.03.27,Network pharmacology-based analysis of the role of traditional Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of COVID-19,"作者:Yu, SW (Yu, Shengwei)[ 1 ] ; Wang, JW (Wang, Junwu)[ 1 ] ; Shen, HT (Shen, Haitao)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,345 Talent Project of Shenjing Hospital ,出版年: MAR 2020,"China Med Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Shengjing Hosp, 36 Sanhao St, Shenyang 110004, Peoples R China.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in China. Until now, no definite effective treatment has been identified. We reported on 3 patients with severe COV1D-19 who received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) with satisfactory recovery. Based on these observations, randomized studies of high-dose IVIg should be considered in deteriorating patients infected with COVID-19.

"摘要
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, coincided with chunyun, the period of mass migration for the annual Spring Festival. To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic.

Methods: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic.

Results: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction.

Conclusions: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.",作者关键词:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); epidemic; modeling; Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR),文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE,10.21037/jtd.2020.02.64,Modified SEIR and AI prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China under public health interventions,"作者:Yang, ZF (Yang, Zifeng)[ 1,2 ] ; Zeng, ZQ (Zeng, Zhiqi)[ 1 ] ; Wang, K (Wang, Ke)[ 3 ] ; Wong, SS (Wong, Sook-San)[ 1,4 ] ; Liang, WH (Liang, Wenhua)[ 1 ] ; Zanin, M (Zanin, Mark)[ 1,4 ] ; Liu, P (Liu, Peng)[ 5 ] ; Cao, XD (Cao, Xudong)[ 5 ] ; Gao, ZQ (Gao, Zhongqiang)[ 5 ] ; Mai, ZT (Mai, Zhitong)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Respiratory System,Science Research Project of the Guangdong Province (Nanshan Zhong) ,出版年: MAR 2020,"Guangzhou Med Univ, State Key Lab Resp Dis, Natl Clin Res Ctr Resp Dis, Guangzhou Inst Resp Hlth,Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou 510230, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

"摘要
One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.

"摘要
On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries. Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency. Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.

"摘要
A severe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019, and spread so rapidly that more than 200,000 cases have so far been reported worldwide; on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared it the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The two previously reported coronavirus epidemics (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]) share similar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features to COVID-19. As little is currently known about SARS-CoV-2, it is likely that lessons learned from these major epidemics can be applied to the new pandemic, including the use of novel immunosuppressive drugs.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; CoVID-19; cytokines; treatment; biological agents,文献类型:Review,CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RHEUMATOLOGY,MAR-APR 2020,"COVID-19, cytokines and immunosuppression: what can we learn from severe acute respiratory syndrome?","作者:Sarzi-Puttini, P (Sarzi-Puttini, P.)[ 1 ] ; Giorgi, V (Giorgi, V.)[ 1 ] ; Sirotti, S (Sirotti, S.)[ 1 ] ; Marotto, D (Marotto, D.)[ 2 ] ; Ardizzone, S (Ardizzone, S.)[ 3 ] ; Rizzardini, G (Rizzardini, G.)[ 4 ] ; Antinori, S (Antinori, S.)[ 5,6 ] ; Galli, M (Galli, M.)[ 5,6 ]",研究方向:Rheumatology,,出版年: MAR-APR 2020,"ASST Fatebenefratelli L Sacco Univ Hosp, Via GB Grassi 74, I-20157 Milan, Italy.

"摘要
COVID-19 has affected the United States leading to a national emergency with health care and economic impact, propelling the country into a recession with disrupted lifestyles not seen in recent history. COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied.

The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.

In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU.

In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States.

The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis.

1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.

"摘要
2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (31) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 31 Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 31 Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.",,文献类型:Article,WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760,2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus,"作者:Koenig, KL (Koenig, Kristi L.)[ 1,2 ] ; Bey, CK (Bey, Christian K.)[ 3 ] ; McDonald, EC (McDonald, Eric C.)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Emergency Medicine,,出版年: MAR 2020,"Hlth & Human Serv Agcy, Cty San Diego, Emergency Med Serv, 6255 Mission Gorge Rd, San Diego, CA 92120 USA.

"摘要
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days will be of less significance (C) 2020 The Authors.

"摘要
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic starting in Wuhan in December, 2019 has spread rapidly throughout the nation. The control measures to contain the epidemic also produced influences on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and adjustments in the management of the patients need to be made at this particular time. AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential. To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation. For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients. During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis. In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.

Objective To explore the value of the ""dandelion clock-like"" sign on chest CT for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. Methods This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. Results Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV- 2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like ""crazy-paving"" patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV- 2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5% , 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a ""dandelion clek-like"" sign and 37 with a ""dandelion seed sign"". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia. Conclusion The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.

"摘要
The ongoing epidemic of caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 starting in December 2019 poses a serious public health threat globally. The virus is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through droplets and contacts, and is associated with a high risk of pneumonia. A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death. The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak. In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system. These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches.

In the ongoing fight against the epidemic of COVID-19, the medical staff has been under tremendous pressure. Wearing the protective equipment (masks, goggles, and protective screens) with a poor breathability for a long time causes various skin problems, such as allergies, excessive skin hydration, local mechanical injuries, and even secondary infections. In addition, in a closed environment, compression and friction aggravate skin reactions, which may compromise duty performance of the medical staff. It is therefore essential to provide timely treatment opinions and prevention methods for common skin problems. We also give suggestions concerning the preparation of medical kit for skin protection in the epidemic area.

Objective To investigate the mental health status of college students during the epidemic of COVID-19 and identify the factors influencing the mental health of the students. Methods Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. Results The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. Conclusion The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.

"摘要
Background The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19. With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. Methods All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution. Findings The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.",作者关键词:2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Infection; Imaging features; Computed tomography; Ground glass opacification,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING,10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9,Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"作者:Xu, X (Xu, Xi)[ 1 ] ; Yu, CC (Yu, Chengcheng)[ 2 ] ; Qu, J (Qu, Jing)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, LG (Zhang, Lieguang)[ 2 ] ; Jiang, SF (Jiang, Songfeng)[ 2 ] ; Huang, DY (Huang, Deyang)[ 2 ] ; Chen, BH (Chen, Bihua)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, ZP (Zhang, Zhiping)[ 2 ] ; Guan, WH (Guan, Wanhua)[ 2 ] ; Ling, ZK (Ling, Zhoukun)[ 2 ] ...更多内容","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: MAY 2020,"Jinan Univ, Dept Med Imaging Ctr, Affiliated Hosp 1, 613,Huangpu Rd West, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; formally known as 2019-nCoV) has become a most challenging health emergency. Owing to rigorous quarantine and control measures taken in China, routine neonatal health surveillance and follow-up have become challenging. Without follow-up surveillance, some rapid and progressive newborn diseases, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, may be ignored. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, we developed an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of bilirubin level of newborns that is based on our practical experiences. The aim is to make our management strategies of neonatal jaundice tailored to the infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 epidemic.",作者关键词:New coronavirus pneumonia; Hyperbilirubinemia; Newborn; Follow-up; Internet hospital,文献类型:Review; Early Access,WORLD JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,10.1007/s12519-020-00347-3,Management strategies of neonatal jaundice during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak,"作者:Ma, XL (Ma, Xiao-Lu)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, Z (Chen, Zheng)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhu, JJ (Zhu, Jia-Jun)[ 3 ] ; Shen, XX (Shen, Xiao-Xia)[ 1,2 ] ; Wu, MY (Wu, Ming-Yuan)[ 3 ] ; Shi, LP (Shi, Li-Ping)[ 1,2 ] ; Du, LZ (Du, Li-Zhong)[ 1,2 ] ; Fu, JF (Fu, Jun-Fen)[ 1,2 ] ; Shu, Q (Shu, Qiang)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:Pediatrics,Zhejiang University Special Scientific Research Fund for COVID-19 Prevention and Control ,FEB 2020,"Zhejiang Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Hangzhou 310052, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Almost half of the confirmed COVID-19 cases detected so far in the United Kingdom are part of a large cluster of 13 British nationals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, Spain, and France. Transmissions among this cluster occurred at a ski resort in France, and originated from a single infected traveller returning from a conference in Singapore where he acquired the virus. At least 21 individuals were exposed to the virus, tested, and quarantined, with 13 of those testing positive between the period of 6th February and 15th February. Here, all publicly available information about the primarily UK/France cluster is consolidated, providing a complete and accessible summary of the cases and their connections. Notable in this cluster are the number of individuals infected, the apparent absence of any severe illness among those infected, and a case of a ""delayed positive"" test during isolation after initially testing negative, at least 7 days after last possible contact.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; cluster description; case description,文献类型:Article,SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY,w20212,"Preliminary case report on the SARS-CoV-2 cluster in the UK, France, and Spain","作者:Emma, BH (Emma, Hodcroft B.)[ 1,2 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: FEB 27 2020,"Biozentrum, Klingelbergstr 70, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.

Most cases and sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy.

"摘要
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a growing focus of global attention and a critical factor in public-health decision making. Towards fighting the COVID-19 outbreak, countries worldwide and international organisations have taken various actions, including promoting the transparency of and public access to disease data. In such public communications, maps have played an important role in that a map is worth a thousand words. Most of these have taken the form of a choropleth map. Here, we propose employing cartograms to visualise both the expansion and spread of COVID-19. We designed a combination of six circular cartograms containing the data of confirmed cases every 48 hours from 24 January to 3 February 2020. Such a design conveys both spatial and temporal information more intuitively and efficiently, so it can be expected to facilitate better public participation in the fight against COVID-19.",作者关键词:Cartogram; visualisation; graphic,文献类型:Article; Early Access,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,0308518X20910162,Visualising the expansion and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 by cartograms,"作者:Gao, PC (Gao, Peichao)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhang, H (Zhang, Hong)[ 3 ] ; Wu, ZW (Wu, Zhiwei)[ 3 ] ; Wang, JC (Wang, Jicheng)[ 3,4,5 ]",研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,10.1177/0308518X20910162,"Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn, Chengdu 611756, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

"摘要
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health emergency in China. Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3℃ ), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period. Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non - surgical anti - tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation / percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.
摘要:当前,我国新型冠状病毒肺炎(简称新冠肺炎)的疫情形势严峻,全国医护人员都义不容辞地肩负起了抗击疫情的重任。作为胃肠外科医师,我们应积极学习新冠肺炎的相关知识,科学应对,把防疫的意识渗透到临床工作的每个诊疗细节和临床操作中去。对于胃肠肿瘤患者,首先应做好入院前筛查,肺部CT应作为常规检查项目。经过严密筛查的患者入院后术前检查时需加强防护措施,包括医护人员的自我防护；诊疗过的器械或物品应妥善丢弃,或按规范流程进行消毒,严防交叉感染。对于胃肠道良性肿瘤,如无合并明显出血或梗阻,不建议在这个非常时期进行手术治疗,可待疫情高峰期过后择期手术。对于进展期胃肠恶性肿瘤患者,建议经过多学科联合会诊(MDT),如果符合新辅助治疗指征,应优先选择新辅助治疗而推迟手术。胃肠道肿瘤合并梗阻或出血的病例可考虑通过内镜或介入治疗解除梗阻或止血；若肿瘤合并出血保守治疗及内镜治疗无效,可尝试于介入下进行选择性血管栓塞；合并梗阻但没有合并腹膜炎者,肠道支架置入具有较高的解除梗阻成功率,大部分患者可免于急诊手术。对于胃窦肿瘤合并胃潴留、食管胃结合部肿瘤合并食管梗阻的患者,可留置胃管和空肠营养管,进行减压和营养支持以缓解症状,为限期手术创造更好的身体情况。对于确实需要手术、且疑似或确诊新冠肺炎患者,在向医院、疾控中心进行报备的前提下,最好转至定点医院诊治,或于专门隔离病区进行术前准备、专门的通道进行转运以及专门的感染手术室进行手术；麻醉医师在三级预防的基础上注意配戴防护面罩进行气管插管及拔管,以防飞沫喷溅。对于下消化道手术,应更积极行预防性肠造口。术后对手术间进行彻底消毒。对于手术后发热患者,应与新冠肺炎相鉴别,若伴咳嗽、咳痰者,应按疑似新冠肺炎病例的标准进行单间隔离和相关检查。相信通过医患双方的共同努力,取得这场防疫战争的胜利将指日可待！","作者关键词:Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); Gastrointestinal tumor,treatment strategy; Multidisciplinary therapy",文献类型:Article,Chinese Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery,,Treatment strategy for gastrointestinal tumor under the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China,作者:Chen Yonghe; Peng Junsheng,研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: 2020,"地址: Chen Yonghe, Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery,The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510655, China.

"摘要
With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.",作者关键词:antiviral agents; coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; SARS; spike proteins; RdRp; 3CLpro,文献类型:Article,CHEMBIOCHEM,10.1002/cbic.202000047,Learning from the Past: Possible Urgent Prevention and Treatment Options for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Caused by 2019-nCoV,"作者:Morse, JS (Morse, Jared S.)[ 1 ] ; Lalonde, T (Lalonde, Tyler)[ 1 ] ; Xu, SQ (Xu, Shiqing)[ 1 ] ; Liu, WR (Liu, Wenshe Ray)[ 1 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

"摘要
An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R-0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R-t. In the first assumption, R-t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R-t = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R-t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R-t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R-t = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R-t to an ideal level and control the infection.",,文献类型:Article,CELL DISCOVERY,10,"Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China","作者:Wang, HW (Wang, Huwen)[ 1 ] ; Wang, ZZ (Wang, Zezhou)[ 2,3 ] ; Dong, YQ (Dong, Yinqiao)[ 4 ] ; Chang, RJ (Chang, Ruijie)[ 1 ] ; Xu, C (Xu, Chen)[ 1 ] ; Yu, XY (Yu, Xiaoyue)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, SX (Zhang, Shuxian)[ 1 ] ; Tsamlag, L (Tsamlag, Lhakpa)[ 1 ] ; Shang, ML (Shang, Meili)[ 5 ] ; Huang, JY (Huang, Jinyan)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Cell Biology,Medicine and Engineering Interdisciplinary Research Fund of Shanghai Jiao Tong University ,出版年: FEB 24 2020,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Sch Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.",,文献类型:Article,ELIFE,e55570,Estimated effectiveness of symptom and risk screening to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"作者:Gostic, K (Gostic, Katelyn)[ 1 ] ; Gomez, ACR (Gomez, Ana C.

"摘要
As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries in the world. With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated. However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking. Here, we present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown. This report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Viral Load Kinetics,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e86,Viral Load Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in First Two Patients in Korea,"作者:Kim, JY (Kim, Jin Yong)[ 1 ] ; Ko, JH (Ko, Jae-Hoon)[ 2 ] ; Kim, Y (Kim, Yeonjae)[ 3 ] ; Kim, YJ (Kim, Yae-Jean)[ 4 ] ; Kim, JM (Kim, Jeong-Min)[ 5 ] ; Chung, YS (Chung, Yoon-Seok)[ 5 ] ; Kim, HM (Kim, Heui Man)[ 5 ] ; Han, MG (Han, Myung-Guk)[ 5 ] ; Kim, SY (Kim, So Yeon)[ 6 ] ; Chin, BS (Chin, Bum Sik)[ 3 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: FEB 24 2020,"Natl Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, 245 Eulji Ro, Seoul 04564, South Korea.

"摘要
Purpose The aim of this case series is to illustrate the F-18-FDG PET/CT findings of patients with acute respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. Methods We describe the F-18-FDG PET/CT results from four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. A retrospective review of the patients' medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. Results All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high F-18-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. Conclusions Although F-18-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases.",作者关键词:COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Infection; Acute respiratory disease; F-18-FDG PET; CT; Ground-glass opacities; Consolidative opacities,文献类型:Article,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING,10.1007/s00259-020-04734-w,F-18-FDG PET/CT findings of COVID-19: a series of four highly suspected cases,"作者:Qin, CX (Qin, Chunxia)[ 1,2 ] ; Liu, F (Liu, Fang)[ 1,2 ] ; Yen, TC (Yen, Tzu-Chen)[ 3,4,5 ] ; Lan, XL (Lan, Xiaoli)[ 1,2 ]","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,出版年: MAY 2020,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Nucl Med, 1277 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan 430022, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Optogenetics has recently gained recognition as a biological technique to control the activity of cells using light stimulation. Many studies have applied optogenetics to cell lines in the central nervous system because it has the potential to elucidate neural circuits, treat neurological diseases and promote nerve regeneration. There have been fewer studies on the application of optogenetics in the peripheral nervous system. This review introduces the basic principles and approaches of optogenetics and summarizes the physiology and mechanism of opsins and how the technology enables bidirectional control of unique cell lines with superior spatial and temporal accuracy. Further, this review explores and discusses the therapeutic potential for the development of optogenetics and its capacity to revolutionize treatment for refractory epilepsy, depression, pain, and other nervous system disorders, with a focus on neural regeneration, especially in the peripheral nervous system. Additionally, this review synthesizes the latest preclinical research on optogenetic stimulation, including studies on non-human primates, summarizes the challenges, and highlights future perspectives. The potential of optogenetic stimulation to optimize therapy for peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) is also highlighted. Optogenetic technology has already generated exciting, preliminary evidence, supporting its role in applications to several neurological diseases, including PNIs.",作者关键词:Optogenetics; opsin; nerve regeneration; central nervous system; peripheral nervous system,文献类型:Review,CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1080/10409238.2020.1726279,New era of optogenetics: from the central to peripheral nervous system,"作者:Xu, X (Xu, Xiang)[ 1 ] ; Mee, T (Mee, Thomas)[ 1 ] ; Jia, XF (Jia, Xiaofeng)[ 1,2,3,4,5 ]",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,"Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund, USA ",出版年: JAN 2 2020,"Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, 10 South Pine St,MSTF Bldg 823, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.

"摘要
There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 17 other countries. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak sites and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the virology, epidemiology, clinical management strategies from both English and Chinese literature, official news channels, and other official government documents. In addition, by fitting the number of infections with a single-term exponential model, we report that the infection is spreading at an exponential rate, with a doubling period of 1.8 days.",作者关键词:2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; Wuhan; China; Epidemiology; Virology; Clinical guideline; Literature survey; Review; Literature review; Novel coronavirus; COVID-19,文献类型:Review,INFECTION,10.1007/s15010-020-01401-y,2019 Novel coronavirus: where we are and what we know,"作者:Cheng, ZKJ (Cheng, Zhangkai J.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Shan, J (Shan, Jing)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,出版年: APR 2020,"Shenzhen Univ, Sch Med, Inst Allergy & Immunol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.

Objective Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. Methods Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. Results The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). Conclusions Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.",作者关键词:Chinese medicine; corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19); prevention program; clinical evidence; review,文献类型:Review,CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE,10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6,"Can Chinese Medicine Be Used for Prevention of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

"摘要
Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, beta-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.",作者关键词:Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pneumonia; Tertiary Infection; Viral Load; Real Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,文献类型:Article,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,e79,Case of the Index Patient Who Caused Tertiary Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea: the Application of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for the Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia Monitored by Quantitative RT-PCR,"作者:Lim, J (Lim, Jaegyun)[ 1 ] ; Jeon, S (Jeon, Seunghyun)[ 2 ] ; Shin, HY (Shin, Hyun-Young)[ 3 ] ; Kim, MJ (Kim, Moon Jung)[ 1 ] ; Seong, YM (Seong, Yu Min)[ 4 ] ; Lee, WJ (Lee, Wang Jun)[ 5 ] ; Choe, KW (Choe, Kang-Won)[ 6 ] ; Kang, YM (Kang, Yu Min)[ 6 ] ; Lee, B (Lee, Baeckseung)[ 7 ] ; Park, SJ (Park, Sang-Joon)[ 8 ]",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,,出版年: FEB 17 2020,"CancerROP, 173 Digital Ro, Seoul 08511, South Korea.

"摘要
Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.

Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.

Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.

Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration between all parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging threats is required to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.",,文献类型:Article,EUROSURVEILLANCE,2000094,"First cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in France: surveillance, investigations and control measures, January 2020","作者:Stoecklin, SB (Stoecklin, Sibylle Bernard)[ 1 ] ; Rolland, P (Rolland, Patrick)[ 2 ] ; Silue, Y (Silue, Yassoungo)[ 3 ] ; Mailles, A (Mailles, Alexandra)[ 1 ] ; Campese, C (Campese, Christine)[ 1 ] ; Simondon, A (Simondon, Anne)[ 4 ] ; Mechain, M (Mechain, Matthieu)[ 5 ] ; Meurice, L (Meurice, Laure)[ 6 ] ; Nguyen, M (Nguyen, Mathieu)[ 5 ] ; Bassi, C (Bassi, Clement)[ 3 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,,出版年: FEB 13 2020,"Sante Publ France, Direct Malad Infect, St Maurice, France.

"摘要
A global health emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization as the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads across the world, with confirmed patients in Canada. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.",作者关键词:COVID-19,文献类型:Review,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE,10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x,Practical recommendations for critical care and anesthesiology teams caring for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients,"作者:Wax, RS (Wax, Randy S.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Christian, MD (Christian, Michael D.)[ 4 ]",研究方向:Anesthesiology,,出版年: MAY 2020,"Queens Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Crit Care Med, Kingston, ON, Canada.

In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named ""2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)"" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.",作者关键词:2019 novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; Respiratory disease; Pneumonia; Infectious diseases; Rapid advice guideline; Clinical practice guideline; Evidence-based medicine,文献类型:Article,MILITARY MEDICAL RESEARCH,4,A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version),"作者:Jin, YH (Jin, Ying-Hui)[ 1 ] ; Cai, L (Cai, Lin)[ 2 ] ; Cheng, ZS (Cheng, Zhen-Shun)[ 3 ] ; Cheng, H (Cheng, Hong)[ 4 ] ; Deng, T (Deng, Tong)[ 1,5 ] ; Fan, YP (Fan, Yi-Pin)[ 6,7 ] ; Fang, C (Fang, Cheng)[ 1 ] ; Huang, D (Huang, Di)[ 1 ] ; Huang, LQ (Huang, Lu-Qi)[ 6,7 ] ; Huang, Q (Huang, Qiao)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,"Entrusted Project of National Center for Medical Service Administration, National Health and Family Planning Commission China ",出版年: FEB 6 2020,"Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based & Translat Med, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health. Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.",作者关键词:adenovirus; coronavirus; diagnostic methods; influenza virus; respiratory syncytial virus; respiratory viral infection; rhinovirus,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25674,Recent advances in the detection of respiratory virus infection in humans,"作者:Zhang, NR (Zhang, Naru)[ 1 ] ; Wang, LL (Wang, Lili)[ 2 ] ; Deng, XQ (Deng, Xiaoqian)[ 3 ] ; Liang, RY (Liang, Ruiying)[ 3 ] ; Su, M (Su, Meng)[ 3 ] ; He, C (He, Chen)[ 3 ] ; Hu, LF (Hu, Lanfang)[ 3 ] ; Su, YD (Su, Yudan)[ 3 ] ; Ren, J (Ren, Jing)[ 3 ] ; Yu, F (Yu, Fei)[ 3 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,Hebei Province's Program for Talents Returning from Studying Overseas ,出版年: APR 2020,"Hebei Agr Univ, Coll Life & Sci, State Key Lab North China Crop Improvement & Regu, Baoding, Peoples R China.

"摘要
Objectives Following reports of patients with unexplained pneumonia at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the causative agent was identified as coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Putative patients with COVID-19 have been identified in South Korea, and attempts have been made to isolate the pathogen from these patients.Methods Upper and lower respiratory tract secretion samples from putative patients with COVID-19 were inoculated onto cells to isolate the virus. Full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used to identify the virus.Results The virus replicated in Vero cells and cytopathic effects were observed. Full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome exhibited sequence homology of more than 99.9% with SARS-CoV-2 which was isolated from patients from other countries, for instance China. Sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was 77.5% and 50%, respectively. Coronavirus-specific morphology was observed by electron microscopy in virus-infected Vero cells.Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from putative patients with unexplained pneumonia and intermittent coughing and fever. The isolated virus was named BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020.",作者关键词: COVID-19; coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; isolation; pneumonia,文献类型: research-article,Osong Public Health and Research Persptectives,Osong Public Health and Research Persptectives,Identification of Coronavirus Isolated from a Patient in Korea with COVID-19,"作者:Kim, Jeong-Min; Han, Myung-Guk",,,出版年: 2020,

Objectives Following reports of patients with unexplained pneumonia at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the causative agent was identified as coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Putative patients with COVID-19 have been identified in South Korea, and attempts have been made to isolate the pathogen from these patients.Methods Upper and lower respiratory tract secretion samples from putative patients with COVID-19 were inoculated onto cells to isolate the virus. Full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used to identify the virus.Results The virus replicated in Vero cells and cytopathic effects were observed. Full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome exhibited sequence homology of more than 99.9% with SARS-CoV-2 which was isolated from patients from other countries, for instance China. Sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was 77.5% and 50%, respectively. Coronavirus-specific morphology was observed by electron microscopy in virus-infected Vero cells.Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from putative patients with unexplained pneumonia and intermittent coughing and fever.

"摘要
Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health. Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.",作者关键词:adenovirus; coronavirus; diagnostic methods; influenza virus; respiratory syncytial virus; respiratory viral infection; rhinovirus,文献类型:Review,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/jmv.25674,Recent advances in the detection of respiratory virus infection in humans,"作者:Zhang, NR (Zhang, Naru)[ 1 ] ; Wang, LL (Wang, Lili)[ 2 ] ; Deng, XQ (Deng, Xiaoqian)[ 3 ] ; Liang, RY (Liang, Ruiying)[ 3 ] ; Su, M (Su, Meng)[ 3 ] ; He, C (He, Chen)[ 3 ] ; Hu, LF (Hu, Lanfang)[ 3 ] ; Su, YD (Su, Yudan)[ 3 ] ; Ren, J (Ren, Jing)[ 3 ] ; Yu, F (Yu, Fei)[ 3 ] ...更多内容",研究方向:Virology,Hebei Province's Program for Talents Returning from Studying Overseas ,出版年: APR 2020,"Hebei Agr Univ, Coll Life & Sci, State Key Lab North China Crop Improvement & Regu, Baoding, Peoples R China.
