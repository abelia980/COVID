So far, there is a lack of effective drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia. With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100 clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies. Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would last for 1 to 11 months. The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been determined. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for drug treatment. Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003, China has the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in emergency period.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Editorial Material,出版年: JUN 2020,,"作者:Zhang, Q (Zhang, Qi)[ 1 ] ; Wang, YK (Wang, Yakun)[ 1 ] ; Qi, CS (Qi, Changsong)[ 1 ] ; Shen, L (Shen, Lin)[ 1 ] ; Li, J (Li, Jian)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Peking Univ, Canc Hosp & Inst, Key Lab Carcinogenesis & Translat Res, Dept Gastrointestinal Oncol,Minist Educ, Fucheng Rd 52, Beijing 100142, Peoples R China.

Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases have been reported in Wuhan, China. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over the world, especially in China.

Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Review,出版年: JUN 2020,,"作者:Li, YC (Li, Yan-Chao)[ 1 ] ; Bai, WZ (Bai, Wan-Zhu)[ 2 ] ; Hashikawa, T (Hashikawa, Tsutomu)[ 3 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Jilin Univ, Dept Histol & Embryol, Coll Basic Med Sci, Norman Bethune Coll Med, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China.

The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical data, discharge rate, and fatality rate of COVID-19 patients for clinical help. The clinical data of COVID-19 patients from December 2019 to February 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients and explained the discharge rate and fatality rate with a single-arm meta-analysis. The available data of 1994 patients in 10 literatures were included in our study. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%). Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.9%). The results of the laboratory showed that the lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of C-reactive protein (44.3%), increase of lactic dehydrogenase (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%) were more common. The results of single-arm meta-analysis showed that the male took a larger percentage in the gender distribution of COVID-19 patients 60% (95% CI [0.54, 0.65]), the discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 52% (95% CI [0.34,0.70]), and the fatality rate was 5% (95% CI [0.01,0.11]).",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Review,出版年: JUN 2020,Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province ,"作者:Li, LQ (Li, Long-quan)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Huang, T (Huang, Tian)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Wang, YQ (Wang, Yong-qing)[ 4 ] ; Wang, ZP (Wang, Zheng-ping)[ 5 ] ; Liang, Y (Liang, Yuan)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Huang, TB (Huang, Tao-bi)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhang, HY (Zhang, Hui-yun)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Sun, WM (Sun, Weiming)[ 6 ] ; Wang, YP (Wang, Yuping)[ 2,3 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Lanzhou Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Endocrinol, 1 West Donggang Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.

Objective We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis.

Results Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061).

Conclusion Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare. The case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This meta-analysis also has limitations, so the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: JUN 2020,,"作者:Sun, PF (Sun, Pengfei)[ 1 ] ; Qie, SY (Qie, Shuyan)[ 2 ] ; Liu, ZJ (Liu, Zongjian)[ 2 ] ; Ren, JZ (Ren, Jizhen)[ 3 ] ; Li, K (Li, Kun)[ 4 ] ; Xi, JN (Xi, Jianing)[ 5 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Capital Med Univ, Beijing Rehabil Hosp, Bada Rd, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.

The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.",研究方向:Immunology,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAY 2020,Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation General Program ,"作者:Yang, YS (Yang, Yongshi)[ 1 ] ; Peng, FJ (Peng, Fujun)[ 2,3 ] ; Wang, RS (Wang, Runsheng)[ 4,5 ] ; Guan, K (Guan, Kai)[ 1 ] ; Jiang, TJ (Jiang, Taijiao)[ 2,3 ] ; Xu, GG (Xu, Guogang)[ 5,6 ] ; Sun, JY (Sun, Jinlyu)[ 1 ] ; Chang, ROE (Chang, Christopher)[ 7,8 ]",JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY,"Univ Calif Davis, 451 Hlth Sci Dr,Suite 6510, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019 led to large numbers of people being infected and developing atypical pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). Typical imaging manifestations of patients infected with 2019-nCoV has been reported, but we encountered an atypical radiological manifestation on baseline computed tomography (CT) images in three patients from Wuhan, China infected with the 2019-nCoV. Surprisingly, the only similar CT finding was a solitary sub-centimeter ground-glass nodule adjacent to bronchovascular bundles, which could be easily overlooked. In addition, the follow-up images in these patients showed how COVID-19 pneumonia evolved from these small nodules. The radiologic manifestation of the three cases will expand contemporary understanding of COVID-19.","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",文献类型:Editorial Material,出版年: MAY 2020,,"作者:Xia, TY (Xia, Tianyi)[ 1 ] ; Li, JW (Li, Jiawei)[ 2 ] ; Gao, J (Gao, Jiao)[ 2 ] ; Xu, XH (Xu, Xunhua)[ 2 ]",KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,"China Resources & WISCO Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, 209 Yejin Rd, Wuhan 430080, Peoples R China.

Objectives: The aim of the present study was to prevent cross-infection in the operating room during emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by following anesthesia management protocols, and to document clinical- and anesthesia-related characteristics of these patients.

Design: This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study.

Setting: This study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China.

Participants: Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China.

Interventions: Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan.

Measurements and Main Results: Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scanning.

Conclusions: The present study indicates that COVID 19-specific guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room. Most patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography scans.

Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2], COVID-2019 [coronavirus disease 2019], or 2019-nCoV [2019 novel coronavirus]) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in nonhuman animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFN-beta) was shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-IFN-beta also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-IFN-beta against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mouse model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have suggested that proinflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aims to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that have shown potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.",研究方向:Microbiology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAY 2020,Spanish Government,"作者:Martinez, MA (Angel Martinez, Miguel)",ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,,Compounds with Therapeutic Potential against Novel Respiratory 2019 Coronavirus

The current outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus, 2019_nCoV (now named SARS-CoV-2), illustrated difficulties in identifying a novel coronavirus and its natural host, as the coding sequences of various Betacoronavirus species can be highly diverse. By means of whole-genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics.

Significance and Impact of the Study The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.",研究方向:Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAY 2020,,"作者:Wassenaar, TM (Wassenaar, T.

Purpose To discuss the different characteristics of clinical, laboratory, and chest computed tomography (CT) in pediatric patients from adults with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

Methods The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital.

Results Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%).

Conclusion Procalcitonin elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric patients which were different from adults. It is suggested that underlying coinfection may be more common in pediatrics, and the consolidation with surrounding halo sign which is considered as a typical sign in pediatric patients.",研究方向:Pediatrics; Respiratory System,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAY 2020,,"作者:Xia, W (Xia, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Shao, JB (Shao, Jianbo)[ 1 ] ; Guo, Y (Guo, Yu)[ 1 ] ; Peng, XH (Peng, Xuehua)[ 1 ] ; Li, Z (Li, Zhen)[ 2 ] ; Hu, DY (Hu, Daoyu)[ 2 ]",PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan Maternal & Child Healthcare Hosp, Dept Imaging Ctr,Wuhan Childrens Hosp, Wuhan 430015, Hubei, Peoples R China.

In the present study, I propose a novel fitting method to describe the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China. The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively. For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day. But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment. The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions tanhsince in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase. The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial. In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh(.) could satisfy the aforementioned properties. By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results. They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to 0.021%, in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to 0.012%and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of 0.195% in the short-term period of infection. In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February. In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained. A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented. This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China. Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties. Moreover, as many as possible the confirmed and suspected cases should be collected to diagnose or treat.",研究方向:Neurosciences & Neurology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,APR 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Pei, LJ (Pei, Lijun)[ 1 ]",COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS,"Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China.

In this rapid commentary, a mini-review is given of the present state-of-knowledge regarding the etiology and epidemiology of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and the risks for developing Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The available knowledge on the viral genomics, molecular biology and pathogenicity of viruses of the Coronaviridae family and other Nidovirales, forms a helpful template for understanding the present pandemic outbreak. However, important questions remain unanswered about the underlying mechanism causing the very high case fatality ratios (CFR) and mechanisms regarding severe reactions like ARDS, fatal cardiac and renal failures, associated with a number of important comorbidity factors. Immunological reactions to lung alveoles in particular (involving lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cell damage) in late phase ARDS in SARS-like CoV diseases, so far may not have received enough attention.

There have been three major global outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus in the last two decades. The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, is the most dangerous, which spread to 163 countries and 6 continents and caused a major public health emergency worldwide. The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human. As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%. There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important. In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures. We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.","研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",文献类型:Article; Early Access,APR 2020,,"作者:Yang, CL (Yang, Chenglei)[ 1 ] ; Qiu, X (Qiu, Xue)[ 2 ] ; Fan, HR (Fan, Haoran)[ 2 ] ; Jiang, M (Jiang, Mei)[ 2 ] ; Lao, XJ (Lao, Xiaojie)[ 3 ] ; Zeng, YK (Zeng, Yukeng)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, ZM (Zhang, Zhiming)[ 1 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH,"71 Hedi Rd,Bldg 106, Nanning 530021, Guangxi, Peoples R China.

2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

At the beginning of the 21st century, a new deadly infectious disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recognized as a global public health threat. Subsequently, ten years after the initial SARS cases occurred in 2002, new cases of another atypical respiratory disease caused worldwide concern. This disease became known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and was even more lethal than SARS. Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019. For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent. In sum, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by recently discovered coronaviruses that cause flu-like illnesses, but with a clinical outcome that tends to be more severe. As a result of the current importance of coronaviruses in global public health, we conducted a review to summarize and update, above all, the epidemiological historical aspects of the three major diseases in humans caused by coronaviral infection.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Review; Early Access,APR 2020,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"作者:da Costa, VG (da Costa, Vivaldo Gomes)[ 1 ] ; Moreli, ML (Moreli, Marcos Lazaro)[ 2 ] ; Saivish, MV (Saivish, Marielena Vogel)[ 2 ]",ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY,"Univ Brasilia, Dept Cellular Biol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.

An outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection in China has spread across the world. No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-2019. In addition to the recommended antiviral drugs, such as interferon-& x251;, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate, some clinical trials focusing on virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors have been registered and initiated. Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RdRp inhibitor approved for use in influenza, is also considered in several clinical trials. Herein, we summarized the pharmacokinetic characteristics of favipiravir and possible drug-drug interactions from the view of drug metabolism. We hope this will be helpful for the design of clinical trials for favipiravir in COVID-2019, as data regarding in vitro virus inhibition and efficacy in preclinical animal studies are still not available.",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,文献类型:Review; Early Access,APR 2020,National Key R&D Program of China ,"作者:Du, YX (Du Yin-Xiao)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Chen, XP (Chen Xiao-Ping)[ 1,2,3 ]",CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.

Background: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately.

Objective: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic.

Results: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings).

Conclusions: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 21 2020,Qatar National Library ,"作者:Abd-Alrazaq, A (Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa)[ 1 ] ; Alhuwail, D (Alhuwail, Dari)[ 2,3 ] ; Househ, M (Househ, Mowafa)[ 1 ] ; Hamdi, M (Hamdi, Mounir)[ 1 ] ; Shah, Z (Shah, Zubair)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Doha Al Luqta St, Doha, Qatar.

Novel 2019 coronavirus has created havoc across the globe since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and fast spreading potential. While we were able to identify the causative agent within a few days of the disease outbreak, several questions still remain unanswered. In this review, we discuss the extent of virus spread, current statistics, SARS-CoV-2 genome organization, comparison between the novel coronavirus and causative agents involved in previous outbreaks, ongoing clinical trials and myths associated with the virus. Lastly, we provide insights into the future perspectives which could prove useful for the scientific community as they work on finding the cure against the disease.

Impact statement

Early availability of the sequence, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), has prompted efforts towards identifying a safe and effective vaccine in the current public health emergency. To that end, understanding the pathophysiology of disease is crucial for scientists around the world. Since conventional vaccine development and manufacturing may take several years, it is important to think about alternative strategies that we could use to mitigate imminent catastrophe. We hope that this article will open up new avenues and provide insights that could potentially save hundreds of lives affected by COVID-19.",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,文献类型:Review; Early Access,10.1177/1535370220920540,,"作者:Jogalekar, MP (Jogalekar, Manasi P.)[ 1 ] ; Veerabathini, A (Veerabathini, Anurag)[ 2 ] ; Gangadaran, P (Gangadaran, Prakash)[ 3,4 ]",EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,"Kyungpook Natl Univ, Kyungpook Natl Univ Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Nucl Med, Daegu 41944, South Korea.

2019-nCoV epidemic was firstly reported at late December of 2019 and has caused a global outbreak of COVID-19 now. Saliva, a biofluid largely generated from salivary glands in oral cavity, has been reported 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive. Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2. Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice. So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time. Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination. This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",文献类型:Review,出版年: APR 17 2020,Special Funds for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 of Sichuan University ,"作者:Xu, RS (Xu Ruoshi)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Cui, BM (Cui Bomiao)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Duan, XB (Duan Xiaobo)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhang, P (Zhang Ping)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Zhou, XD (Zhou Xuedong)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Yuan, Q (Yuan Quan)[ 1,2,3 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCE,"Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Oral Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China.

Acute respiratory disease caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China. Children and adults show a different clinical course. The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present. The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%), and 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (ranged, 3-12 days) and 4 days (ranged, 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were demic by World Health Organiza more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5%, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20%, 80%). A total of 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs 4%, P=.004). Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children. In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019-nCoV disease, but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,APR 2020,,"作者:Han, YN (Han, Ya-nan)[ 1 ] ; Feng, ZW (Feng, Zhan-wei)[ 2 ] ; Sun, LN (Sun, Li-na)[ 1 ] ; Ren, XX (Ren, Xiao-Xia)[ 1 ] ; Wang, H (Wang, Hua)[ 1 ] ; Xue, YM (Xue, Yong-ming)[ 3 ] ; Wang, Y (Wang, Yi)[ 4 ] ; Fang, Y (Fang, Ying)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Xian Childrens Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Xian 710003, Peoples R China.

Coronaviruses are common human viruses and include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses mainly bind to transmembrane receptor proteins on the human cell membrane through spike proteins (S-proteins), thus releasing the RNA of the virus into the interior of the host cell to cause an infection. In this article, we discuss the mechanism and production of cyclodextrin-soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (CD-sACE2) inclusion compounds in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections by blocking S-proteins. On the basis of the current research evidence, we believe that CD-sACE2 inclusion compounds have the potential to treat COVID-19. We hope that our article can provide a theoretical basis for later experiments.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Letter; Early Access,APR 2020,,"作者:Sun, PF (Sun, Pengfei)[ 1 ] ; Lu, XH (Lu, Xiaosheng)[ 2 ] ; Xu, C (Xu, Chao)[ 1 ] ; Wang, YJ (Wang, Yanjin)[ 3 ] ; Sun, WJ (Sun, Wenjuan)[ 4 ] ; Xi, JN (Xi, Jianing)[ 5 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Capital Med Univ, Beijing Rehabil Hosp, Dept Resp Rehabil, Bada Rd, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.

Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are global public concerns. With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention. Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results. For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Review; Early Access,10.1002/rmv.2106,,"作者:Yan, Y (Yan, Ying)[ 1,2 ] ; Chang, L (Chang, Le)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, LN (Wang, Lunan)[ 1,2,3 ]",REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"1 Dahua Rd, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.

Background: In December 2019, a pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and has rapidly spread around the world since then. Aim: This study aims to understand the research gaps related to COVID-19 and propose recommendations for future research. Methods: We undertook a scoping review of COVID-19, comprehensively searching databases and other sources to identify literature on COVID-19 between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020. We analysed the sources, publication date, type and topic of the retrieved articles/studies.

Results: We included 249 articles in this scoping review. More than half (59.0%) were conducted in China. Guidance/guidelines and consensuses statements (n = 56; 22.5%) were the most common. Most (n = 192; 77.1%) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals, 35 (14.1%) on preprint servers and 22 (8.8%) posted online. Ten genetic studies (4.0%) focused on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 while the topics of molecular studies varied. Nine of 22 epidemiological studies focused on estimating the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection (R-0). Of all identified guidance/guidelines (n = 35), only ten fulfilled the strict principles of evidence-based practice. The number of articles published per day increased rapidly until the end of January.

Conclusion: The number of articles on COVID-19 steadily increased before 6 February 2020. However, they lack diversity and are almost non-existent in some study fields, such as clinical research. The findings suggest that evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies will be improved when more results from clinical research becomes available.",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,文献类型:Review,出版年: APR 16 2020,2020 Key R&D project of Gansu Province ,"作者:Lv, M (Lv, Meng)[ 1,2 ] ; Luo, XF (Luo, Xufei)[ 1,2 ] ; Estill, J (Estill, Janne)[ 3,4 ] ; Liu, YL (Liu, Yunlan)[ 1 ] ; Ren, M (Ren, Mengjuan)[ 1 ] ; Wang, JJ (Wang, Jianjian)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, Q (Wang, Qi)[ 5 ] ; Zhao, SY (Zhao, Siya)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, XH (Wang, Xiaohui)[ 1 ] ; Yang, S (Yang, Shu)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",EUROSURVEILLANCE,"Lanzhou Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.

Otolaryngologists have been infected with COVID-19 at higher rates than other specialties in China and other countries.

In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in the throat swab sample of one patient. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, COVID-19 has spread widely around the world, affecting more than seventy countries. China, with a huge burden of this disease, has taken strong measures to control the spread and improve the curative rate of COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19.

Aim The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people. Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare.

Methods A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020.

Results The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.

Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults.

The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has led to more than seven thousand deaths. Unfortunately, there are no specific drugs available to cure this disease. Type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs) may play an important role in host defense mechanisms. Based on the idea of host-directed therapy (HDT), we performed a negative co-expression analysis using big data of 60 000 Affymetrix expression arrays and 5000 TCGA data sets to determine the functions of TAS2R10, which can be activated by numerous bitter substances. Excitingly, we found that the main functions of TAS2R10 involved controlling infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, suggesting that TAS2R10 is a key trigger of host defense pathways. To quickly guide the clinical treatment of 2019-nCoV, we searched currently available drugs that are agonists of TAS2Rs. We identified many cheap, available, and safe medicines, such as diphenidol, quinine, chloroquine, artemisinin, chlorpheniramine, yohimbine, and dextromethorphan, which may target the most common symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV. We suggest that a cocktail-like recipe of existing bitter drugs may help doctors to fight this catastrophic disease and that the general public may drink or eat bitter substances, such as coffee, tea, or bitter vegetables, to reduce the risk of infection.",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,APR 2020,Pudong Health and Family Planning Commission of Shanghai ,"作者:Li, XQ (Li, Xiangqi)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, CB (Zhang, Chaobao)[ 2 ] ; Liu, LY (Liu, Lianyong)[ 3 ] ; Gu, MJ (Gu, Mingjun)[ 1 ]",FASEB JOURNAL,"Second Mil Med Univ, Shanghai Gongli Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China.

The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of global concern. Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.",研究方向:Rheumatology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,APR 2020,,"作者:Misra, DP (Misra, Durga Prasanna)[ 1 ] ; Agarwal, V (Agarwal, Vikas)[ 1 ] ; Gasparyan, AY (Gasparyan, Armen Yuri)[ 2 ] ; Zimba, O (Zimba, Olena)[ 3 ]",CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY,"Sanjay Gandhi Postgrad Inst Med Sci, Dept Clin Immunol & Rheumatol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.

Introduction: At the end of 2019, Wuhan, a city in China with a population of about 11 million, witnessed the outbreak of unusual pneumonia. As of 29 March 2020, the disease has spread to more 199 countries and territories worldwide. The 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is known as the probable causative agent of the illness. Areas covered: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19. Expert opinion: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19. Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19. Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19. Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19. Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation. The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation.",研究方向:Immunology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,APR 2020,,"作者:Saghazadeh, A (Saghazadeh, Amene)[ 1,2 ] ; Rezaei, N (Rezaei, Nima)[ 3,4,5 ]",EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY,"Childrens Med Ctr Hosp, Dr Qarib St,Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran 14194, Iran.

Background Since December 8, 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, but information about children with COVID-19 is limited.

Methods This retrospective and the single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China. We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha. Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020.

Results By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha. Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days. The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms. Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan. As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged. The median time from exposure to a negative RT-PCR was 14 days.

Conclusions The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients. Children who have a familial clustering or have a family member with a definite diagnosis should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.",研究方向:Pediatrics; Respiratory System,文献类型:Article; Early Access,APR 2020,National key clinical specialist construction Programs of China ,"作者:Shen, QX (Shen, Qinxue)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Guo, W (Guo, Wei)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Guo, T (Guo, Ting)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Li, JH (Li, Jinhua)[ 1,2,3 ] ; He, WL (He, Wenlong)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ni, SS (Ni, Shanshan)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ouyang, XL (Ouyang, Xiaoli)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Liu, JY (Liu, Jiyang)[ 4 ] ; Xie, YL (Xie, Yuanlin)[ 5 ] ; Tan, X (Tan, Xin)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY,"Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, 139 Renmin Middle Rd, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China.

As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, the careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed. In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1. However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-theart bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 3 2020,National Science Foundation (NSF),"作者:Zhang, CX (Zhang, Chengxin)[ 1 ] ; Zheng, W (Zheng, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Huang, XQ (Huang, Xiaoqiang)[ 1 ] ; Bell, EW (Bell, Eric W.)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, XG (Zhou, Xiaogen)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yang)[ 1,2 ]",JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH,"Univ Michigan, Dept Computat Med & Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

Objectives Coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has been used to non-invasively assess both the anatomical and hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis. The current study investigated a new CFD-based method of evaluating pressure-flow curves across a stenosis to further enhance the diagnostic value of cCTA imaging. Methods Fifty-eight patients who underwent both cCTA imaging and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) within 2 weeks were enrolled. The pressure-flow curve-derived parameters, viscous friction (VF) and expansion loss (EL), were compared with conventional cCTA parameters including percent area stenosis (AS) and minimum lumen area (MLA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. FFR <= 0.80 was used to indicate ischemia-causing stenosis. Correlations between FFR and other measurements were calculated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho). Results Sixty-eight stenoses from 58 patients were analyzed. VF, EL, and AS were significantly larger in the group of FFR <= 0.8 while smaller MLA values were observed. The ROC-AUC of VF (0.91, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) was better than that of AS (change in AUC (Delta AUC) 0.27, p < 0.05) and MLA (Delta AUC 0.17, p < 0.05), and ROC-AUC of EL (0.90, 95%CI 0.80-0.96) was also better than that of AS (Delta AUC 0.26, p < 0.05) and MLA (Delta AUC 0.16, p < 0.05). FFR values correlated well with VF (rho = - 0.74 (95% CI - 0.83 to - 0.61, p < 0.0001) and EL (rho = - 0.74 (95% CI - 0.83 to - 0.61, p < 0.0001).

Background: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients.

Methods: We developed two 1-step quantitative real time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested.

Results: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range o f at least seven orders of magnitude (2 x 10(-)(4)-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests.

Conclusions: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.",研究方向:Medical Laboratory Technology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,RGC Theme-based research grant ,"作者:Chu, DKW (Chu, Daniel K.

First reported in China, the 2019 novel coronavirus has been spreading across the globe. Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over. The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation. Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms. Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers. Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission. Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs.",研究方向:Pediatrics,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Ravikumar, N (Ravikumar, Namita)[ 1 ] ; Nallasamy, K (Nallasamy, Karthi)[ 1 ] ; Bansal, A (Bansal, Arun)[ 1 ] ; Angurana, SK (Angurana, Suresh Kumar)[ 1 ] ; Basavaraja, GV (Basavaraja, G.

The 2019-novel coronavirus predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from upper respiratory symptoms to full blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment. Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases. Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus. Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia. At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol. We, herein, provide guidance on non-invasive respiratory support, intubation and management of ARDS in a child with COVID-19.",研究方向:Pediatrics,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Sundaram, M (Sundaram, Manu)[ 1 ] ; Ravikumar, N (Ravikumar, Namita)[ 2 ] ; Bansal, A (Bansal, Arun)[ 2 ] ; Nallasamy, K (Nallasamy, Karthi)[ 2 ] ; Basavaraja, GV (Basavaraja, G.

This paper concerns study of the genome of the Wuhan Seafood Market isolate believed to represent the causative agent of the disease COVID-19. This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace. Preliminary studies using molecular modeling and docking, and in that context the potential value of certain known herbal extracts, are also described.",研究方向:Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Robson, B (Robson, B.)[ 1,2 ]",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,"Ingine Inc, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.

Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.

Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.

Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.

Conclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019-nCoV cross-species transmission.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province,"作者:Ji, W (Ji, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Wang, W (Wang, Wei)[ 2 ] ; Zhao, XF (Zhao, Xiaofang)[ 3 ] ; Zai, JJ (Zai, Junjie)[ 4 ] ; Li, XG (Li, Xingguang)[ 5 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Background: The new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is now causing a severe public health emergency. The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infected individuals by binding human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed in multiple organs including respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems in healthy individuals. These tissues with high expression level of ACE2 seemed to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, it has been reported that patients with tumors were likely to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and indicated poor prognosis.

Methods: The tissue atlas database and the blood atlas were used to analyze the distribution of ACE2 in human tissues or organs of cancers and normal samples. Starbase dataset was applied to predict the prognosis of cancers according to expression level of ACE2.

Results: In this study, we demonstrated a landscape profiling analysis on expression level of ACE2 in pan-cancers and showed the risky of different type of cancers to SARS-CoV-2 according to the expression level of ACE2. In addition, we found that ACE2 was both differential expression and related to the prognosis only in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Relative high expression of ACE2 indicated a favorable prognosis in LIHC, but they might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic continues, with the number of infections and deaths increasing. The respiratory tract is the main route of transmission of the virus, and the majority of symptoms are respiratory relative. Until now, there has been no reports concerning the nervous system onset. We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone. There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion. The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed. At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment. After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered. We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,Wu Jieping Medical Foundation ,"作者:Kong, ZH (Kong, Zhaohong)[ 1 ] ; Wang, JW (Wang, Jingwei)[ 2 ] ; Li, T (Li, Tao)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, ZH (Zhang, Zhaohui)[ 1 ] ; Jian, J (Jian, Jiang)[ 1 ]",ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,"Wuhan Univ, Dept Neurol, Renmin Hosp, Wuhan 430060, Peoples R China.

There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.",研究方向:Pediatrics,文献类型:Review,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Singhal, T (Singhal, Tanu)[ 1 ]",INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,"Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hosp & Med Res Inst, Dept Pediat & Infect Dis, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), has affected the lives of 71,429 people globally. Originating in China, the disease has a rapid progression to other countries. Research suggests remarkable genomic resemblance of 2019-nCoV with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which has a history of a pandemic in 2002. With evidence of nosocomial spread, a number of diligent measures are being employed to constrain its propagation. Hence, the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been established by the World Health Organization (WHO) with strategic objectives for public health to curtail its impact on global health and economy.

作者关键词:2019-nCoV; SARS coronavirus; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; animal reservoir; cross-species transmission; human-to-human transmission,e00127-20,"摘要
Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly GIn493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.

IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-tohuman transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.",研究方向:Microbiology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,EU Horizon 2020 ,"作者:Gorbalenya, AE (Gorbalenya, Alexander E.)[ 1,2,3,4 ] ; Baker, SC (Baker, Susan C.)[ 5 ] ; Baric, RS (Baric, Ralph S.)[ 6 ] ; de Groot, RJ (de Groot, Raoul J.)[ 7 ] ; Drosten, C (Drosten, Christian)[ 8 ] ; Gulyaeva, AA (Gulyaeva, Anastasia A.)[ 2 ] ; Haagmans, BL (Haagmans, Bart L.)[ 9 ] ; Lauber, C (Lauber, Chris)[ 2 ] ; Leontovich, AM (Leontovich, Andrey M.)[ 3,4 ] ; Neuman, BW (Neuman, Benjamin W.)[ 10 ] ...更多内容",NATURE MICROBIOLOGY,"Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Data Sci, Leiden, Netherlands.

Aim To subjectively and objectively evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of a low-dose, long-pitch dual-source chest CT protocol on third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) with spectral shaping at 100Sn kVp for COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. Results The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma. Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (p = 0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT. Conclusions Ultra-low-dose, dual-source, fast CT protocol provides highly diagnostic images for COVID-19 with potential for reduction in dose and motion artifacts.","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Agostini, A (Agostini, Andrea)[ 1,2 ] ; Floridi, C (Floridi, Chiara)[ 1,2 ] ; Borgheresi, A (Borgheresi, Alessandra)[ 2 ] ; Badaloni, M (Badaloni, Myriam)[ 2 ] ; Pirani, PE (Pirani, Paolo Esposto)[ 2 ] ; Terilli, F (Terilli, Filippo)[ 2 ] ; Ottaviani, L (Ottaviani, Letizia)[ 2 ] ; Giovagnoni, A (Giovagnoni, Andrea)[ 1,2 ]",RADIOLOGIA MEDICA,"Univ Hosp Umberto I Lancisi Salesi, Dept Radiol, Div Special & Pediat Radiol, Via Conca 71, I-60126 Ancona, AN, Italy.

Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which has subsequently affected more than 200 countries worldwide including Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa and other places. The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing.

Objective: To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China. To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19.

Methods: Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020. Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed. The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results.

Results: Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 +/- 11.32, 5 males). No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P > 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P < 0.05). Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc.

Conclusion: The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas.

In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from China infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) were reviewed, with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings. Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent. Follow-up imaging in a subset of patients during the study time window often demonstrated mild or moderate progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities.

,10.1148/radiol.2020200274,"摘要
Background: The chest CT findings of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously beendescribed in detail.

Purpose: To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans.

Materials and Methods: Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women; age range 16-76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.

Results: Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocytecount. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients,and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement,while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer ( 431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P,.001). Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P,.001). Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.

Conclusion: Patients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posteri or lungson CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.

A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of China and multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287 cases have been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases have also been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest data, a total of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality reaching approximately 2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs for the human coronavirus. Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of the virus and its clinical characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Thus, the present study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not much but timely reports on the 2019-nCoV. (C) 2020 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Background: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.

Methods: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.

Findings: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.

Interpretation: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

,10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x,"摘要
The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.",研究方向:Cell Biology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,National Megaprojects of China for Major Infectious Diseases ,"作者:Xia, S (Xia, Shuai)[ 1 ] ; Liu, MQ (Liu, Meiqin)[ 2,3 ] ; Wang, C (Wang, Chao)[ 4 ] ; Xu, W (Xu, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Lan, QS (Lan, Qiaoshuai)[ 1 ] ; Feng, SL (Feng, Siliang)[ 4 ] ; Qi, FF (Qi, Feifei)[ 5,6 ] ; Bao, LL (Bao, Linlin)[ 5,6 ] ; Du, LY (Du, Lanying)[ 7 ] ; Liu, SW (Liu, Shuwen)[ 8 ] ...更多内容",CELL RESEARCH,"Fudan Univ, Fudan Jinbo Joint Res Ctr, Sch Basic Med Sci, Key Lab Med Mol Virol MOE NHC CAMS, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.

Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. Methods We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. Results Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO2/FiO(2) > 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO2/FiO(2) <= 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1-2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25-29) vs. 23 (22-25), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO2/FiO(2) significantly improved after 1-2 h of NIV [median 172 (150-208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79-130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%). Conclusions Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO2/FiO(2) were more likely to experience HFNC failure.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 30 2020,special project for emergency clinical research on novel coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing Medical University ,"作者:Wang, K (Wang, Ke)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, W (Zhao, Wei)[ 2 ] ; Li, J (Li, Ji)[ 3 ] ; Shu, WW (Shu, Weiwei)[ 4 ] ; Duan, J (Duan, Jun)[ 5 ]",ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE,"Chongqing Med Univ, Yongchuan Hosp, Dept Crit Care Med, Xuanhua Rd 429, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China.

During an outbreak of respiratory diseases including atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, a previously unknown beta-coronavirus was detected in patients. The newly discovered coronavirus is similar to some beta-coronaviruses found in bats but different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV were found. In this study, we searched the homologous templates of all nonstructural and structural proteins of 2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the nsp8, the nsp9, the nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a protein could be built on the basis of homology templates. Among the structural proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal structures of the proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S protein is a critical target candidate for inhibitor screening or vaccine design against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be useful for further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided drug development and vaccine design.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MAR 2020,High-Level Talent Start-Up Research Project of Foshan University ,"作者:Dong, SJ (Dong, Shengjie)[ 1 ] ; Sun, JC (Sun, Jiachen)[ 2 ] ; Mao, Z (Mao, Zhuo)[ 3 ] ; Wang, L (Wang, Lu)[ 4 ] ; Lu, YL (Lu, Yi-Lin)[ 5 ] ; Li, JS (Li, Jiesen)[ 6,7 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Bohai Univ, Coll New Energy, Jinzhou 121007, Peoples R China.

BackgroundThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.

MethodsWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.

ResultsAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).

ConclusionsOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.)

The authors provide an epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases of infection with the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. This analysis provides estimates of the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number and shows clear evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 26 2020,"Ministry of Science and Technology, China","作者:Li, Q (Li, Qun)[ 1 ] ; Guan, XH (Guan, Xuhua)[ 2 ] ; Wu, P (Wu, Peng)[ 3 ] ; Wang, XY (Wang, Xiaoye)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, L (Zhou, Lei)[ 1 ] ; Tong, YQ (Tong, Yeqing)[ 2 ] ; Ren, RQ (Ren, Ruiqi)[ 1 ] ; Leung, KSM (Leung, Kathy S.

Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to the public health and life in China. Unlike the other 6 identified coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety of manifestations. In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission. Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience. These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve 'zero infection' of doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight 2019-nCoV infection.",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Tan, YT (Tan, Yu-tang)[ 1 ] ; Wang, JW (Wang, Jun-wen)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, K (Zhao, Kai)[ 1 ] ; Han, L (Han, Lin)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, HQ (Zhang, Hua-qiu)[ 1 ] ; Niu, HQ (Niu, Hong-quan)[ 1 ] ; Shu, K (Shu, Kai)[ 1 ] ; Lei, T (Lei, Ting)[ 1 ]",CURRENT MEDICAL SCIENCE,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Neurosurg, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 24 2020,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

The outbreak of a novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the 2019-nCoV infection) in December 2019 is one of the most severe public health emergencies since the founding of People's Republic of China in 1949. Healthcare personnel (HCP) nationwide are facing heavy workloads and high risk of infection, especially those who care for patients at the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei Province. Sadly, as of February 20, 2020, over two thousand COVID-19 cases are confirmed among HCP from 476 hospitals nationwide, with nearly 90% of them from Hubei Province. Based on literature search and interviews with some HCP working at Wuhan, capital city of Hubei, we have summarized some of the effective measures taken to reduce infection among HCP, and also made suggestions for improving occupational safety during an infectious disease outbreak. The experience and lessons learned should be a valuable asset for international health community to contain the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic around the world.",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MAR 2020,,"作者:Zhang, ZR (Zhang, Zhiruo)[ 1 ] ; Liu, SL (Liu, Shelan)[ 2 ] ; Xiang, M (Xiang, Mi)[ 1 ] ; Li, SJ (Li, Shijian)[ 3 ] ; Zhao, DH (Zhao, Dahai)[ 4 ] ; Huang, CL (Huang, Chaolin)[ 5 ] ; Chen, SJ (Chen, Saijuan)[ 6 ]",FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Ruijin Hosp, Natl Res Ctr Translat Med, Key Lab Med Genom,Shanghai Inst Hematol,Sch Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.

The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen and is threatening the global health. Strikingly, more than 28 000 cases and 550 deaths have been reported within two months from disease emergence. Armed with experience from previous epidemics in the last two decades, clinicians, scientists, officials, and citizens in China are all contributing to the prevention of further 2019-nCoV transmission. Efficient preliminary work has enabled us to understand the basic characteristics of 2019-nCoV, but there are still many unanswered questions. It is too early now to judge our performance in this outbreak.

Background An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China. People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. Methods We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. Results The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-gamma (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. Conclusions In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough.

The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.",研究方向:Immunology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MAR 2020,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

This single-center case series describes the demographics, symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and clinical course of 138 patients hospitalized with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) in Wuhan, China, highlighting presumed human-to-human hospital-associated transmission in many cases.

Importance In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 x 10(9)/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions and Relevance In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the ""Complementary Exposure"" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.",研究方向:Cell Biology,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 16 2020,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 13 2020,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAR 13 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Guo, YR (Guo, Yan-Rong)[ 1,2 ] ; Cao, QD (Cao, Qing-Dong)[ 3 ] ; Hong, ZS (Hong, Zhong-Si)[ 4 ] ; Tan, YY (Tan, Yuan-Yang)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, SD (Chen, Shou-Deng)[ 1,2 ] ; Jin, HJ (Jin, Hong-Jun)[ 1,2 ] ; Tan, KS (Tan, Kai-Sen)[ 5 ] ; Wang, DY (Wang, De-Yun)[ 5 ] ; Yan, Y (Yan, Yan)[ 1,2,6 ]",MILITARY MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Guangdong Prov Key Lab Biomed Imaging, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Background Studies have reminded that cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities made patients more susceptible to suffer 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19), and exacerbated the infection. The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. Methods A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. Results A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. Conclusion Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19.

There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health threat. As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China.

In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",文献类型:Editorial Material,出版年: MAR 11 2020,,"作者:Boulos, MKN (Boulos, Maged N.)[ 1 ] ; Geraghty, EM (Geraghty, Estella M.)[ 2 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Informat Management, East Campus, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. While most of the initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, person-to-person transmission has been verified. Given that a vaccine cannot be developed and deployed for at least a year, preventing further transmission relies upon standard principles of containment, two of which are the isolation of known cases and the quarantine of persons believed at high risk of exposure. This note presents probability models for assessing the effectiveness of case isolation and quarantine within a community during the initial phase of an outbreak with illustrations based on early observations from Wuhan.",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MAR 2020,,"作者:Kaplan, EH (Kaplan, Edward H.)[ 1,2,3 ]",HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Yale Sch Management, Operat Res, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China.

Material/Methods: A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors.

Results: Levels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress. Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality.

Conclusions: SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and social support.",研究方向:Research & Experimental Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 5 2020,Basic Research Project of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic of Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Harbin Engineering University) ,"作者:Xiao, H (Xiao, Han)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, Y (Zhang, Yan)[ 2 ] ; Kong, DS (Kong, Desheng)[ 2 ] ; Li, SY (Li, Shiyue)[ 3 ] ; Yang, NX (Yang, Ningxi)[ 2 ]",MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,"Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.

The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, especially in East Asia. This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for the development of 2019-nCoV vaccines.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAY 2020,,"作者:Baruah, V (Baruah, Vargab)[ 1 ] ; Bose, S (Bose, Sujoy)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Gauhati Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Gauhati 781014, Assam, India.

A novel beta-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Here we recommend the infection control measures during dental practice to block the person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals.","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",文献类型:Review,出版年: MAR 3 2020,Emergency Project of Sichuan University ,"作者:Peng, X (Peng, Xian)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Xu, X (Xu, Xin)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Li, YQ (Li, Yuqing)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Cheng, L (Cheng, Lei)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhou, XD (Zhou, Xuedong)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ren, B (Ren, Biao)[ 1,2,3 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCE,"Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp Stomatol, State Key Lab Oral Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China.

The 2019 Coronavirus epidemic, provisionally called 2019-nCoV, was first identified in Wuhan, China, in persons exposed to a seafood or wet market. There is an international push to contain the virus and prevent its spread. It is feasible that potentially infectious samples may be received in histopathology laboratories for diagnosis. This technical note presents disinfection procedures and histotechnology processes that should alleviate the risk of infection to laboratory staff. Using data obtained from similar coronaviruses, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), experts are confident that 70% ethanol and 0.1% sodium hypochlorite should inactivate the virus. Formalin fixation and heating samples to 56oC, as used in routine tissue processing, were found to inactivate several coronaviruses and it is believed that 2019-nCoV would be similarly affected.",研究方向:Cell Biology,文献类型:Article; Early Access,MAR 2020,,"作者:Henwood, AF (Henwood, Anthony F.)[ 1,2 ]",JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY,"Childrens Hosp Westmead, Dept Histopathol, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002. The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.",研究方向:Microbiology,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAR 2020,,"作者:Ashour, HM (Ashour, Hossam M.)[ 1,2 ] ; Elkhatib, WF (Elkhatib, Walid F.)[ 3,4 ] ; Rahman, MM (Rahman, Md.

The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) ,"作者:Ahmed, SF (Ahmed, Syed Faraz)[ 1 ] ; Quadeer, AA (Quadeer, Ahmed A.)[ 1 ] ; McKay, MR (McKay, Matthew R.)[ 1,2 ]",VIRUSES-BASEL,"Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAR 2020,"Ministry of Health and Ministry of Defence, Singapore ","作者:Pang, JX (Pang, Junxiong)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Wang, MX (Wang, Min Xian)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ang, IYH (Ang, Ian Yi Han)[ 1,2 ] ; Tan, SHX (Tan, Sharon Hui Xuan)[ 1,2 ] ; Lewis, RF (Lewis, Ruth Frances)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, JIP (Chen, Jacinta I-Pei)[ 1,2 ] ; Gutierrez, RA (Gutierrez, Ramona A.)[ 4 ] ; Gwee, SXW (Gwee, Sylvia Xiao Wei)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Chua, PEY (Chua, Pearleen Ee Yong)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Yang, Q (Yang, Qian)[ 1,2 ] ...更多内容",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,"Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117549, Singapore.

Recently, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a respiratory infection with significant concern for global public health hazards. With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases arc being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-l9 to as minimum as possible. Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic. Herein, we aim to discuss the latest updates on the origin, genomic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment options and current efforts being made by international health organizations with regards to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAR 2020,,"作者:Sahu, KK (Sahu, Kamal Kant)[ 1 ] ; Mishra, AK (Mishra, Ajay Kumar)[ 1 ] ; Lal, A (Lal, Amos)[ 2 ]",ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,"Mayo Clin, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.

After the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, we estimated the distribution and scale of more than 5 million migrants residing in Wuhan after they returned to their hometown communities in Hubei Province or other provinces at the end of 2019 by using the data from the 2013-2018 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We found that the distribution of Wuhan's migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan's migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan's total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan's migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3-4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan's migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.","研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,Youth Program of the National Social Science Fund of China ,"作者:Fan, CY (Fan, Changyu)[ 1 ] ; Liu, LP (Liu, Linping)[ 2,3 ] ; Guo, W (Guo, Wei)[ 3 ] ; Yang, AU (Yang, Anuo)[ 3 ] ; Ye, CC (Ye, Chenchen)[ 3 ] ; Jilili, M (Jilili, Maitixirepu)[ 3 ] ; Ren, MN (Ren, Meina)[ 3 ] ; Xu, P (Xu, Peng)[ 4 ] ; Long, HX (Long, Hexing)[ 5 ] ; Wang, YF (Wang, Yufan)[ 1 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Hangzhou Normal Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou 311121, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Beginning in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to 2019-nCoV infection, emerged in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China and even worldwide. Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/ threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, ox- idative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Wang, YX (Wang, Y-X)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Ma, JR (Ma, J-R)[ 4 ] ; Wang, SQ (Wang, S-Q)[ 5 ] ; Zeng, YQ (Zeng, Y-Q)[ 6 ] ; Zhou, CY (Zhou, C-Y)[ 5 ] ; Ru, YH (Ru, Y-H)[ 7 ] ; Zhang, L (Zhang, L.)[ 1 ] ; Lu, ZG (Lu, Z-G)[ 2 ] ; Wu, MH (Wu, M-H)[ 1 ] ; Li, H (Li, H.)[ 1 ]",EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Jiangsu Prov Hosp Chinese Med, Dept Neurol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which outbroke in December 2019 is highly contagious with a low cure rate. In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared.

RESULTS: Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group.

CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation: experimental study on the role of IL-6-INDUCED exosome pathway in promoting invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by omitting microRNA-133a-3p ,"作者:Ye, XT (Ye, X-T)[ 1 ] ; Luo, YL (Luo, Y-L)[ 1 ] ; Xia, SC (Xia, S-C)[ 2 ] ; Sun, QF (Sun, Q-F)[ 1 ] ; Ding, JG (Ding, J-G)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, Y (Zhou, Y.)[ 1 ] ; Chen, W (Chen, W.)[ 1 ] ; Wang, XF (Wang, X-F)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, WW (Zhang, W-W)[ 1 ] ; Du, WJ (Du, W-J)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Ruian Peoples Hosp, Dept Infect, Ruian, Peoples R China.

Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan. These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.","研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",文献类型:Review,出版年: MAR 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Sun, Z (Sun, Zhong)[ 1 ] ; Thilakavathy, K (Thilakavathy, Karuppiah)[ 1,2 ] ; Kumar, SS (Kumar, S.

Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21"" century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R-0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.

Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (gamma), we estimated R-0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.

Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R-0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R-0.

Conclusion: The mean estimate of R-0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective.

As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in 'lockdown' directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation's economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,,"作者:Allam, Z (Allam, Zaheer)[ 1 ] ; Jones, DS (Jones, David S.)[ 2 ]",HEALTHCARE,"PLDI, Port Louis 11302, Mauritius.

Risk communication is critical to emergency management. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the effective process and attention points of risk communication reflecting on the COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China. We provide the timeline of risk communication progress in Wuhan and use a message-centered approach to identify problems that it entailed. It was found that the delayed decision making of the local government officials and the limited information disclosure should be mainly responsible for the ineffective risk communication. The principles for effective risk communication concerning Wuhan's outbreak management were also discussed. The whole communication process is suggested to integrate the accessibility and openness of risk information, the timing and frequency of communication, and the strategies dealing with uncertainties. Based on these principles and lessons from Wuhan's case, this paper employed a simplified Government-Expert-Public risk communication model to illustrate a collaborative network for effective risk communication.",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,National Social Science Fund Youth Program ,"作者:Zhang, LW (Zhang, Liwei)[ 1 ] ; Li, HJ (Li, Huijie)[ 1 ] ; Chen, KL (Chen, Kelin)[ 2 ]",HEALTHCARE,"Jilin Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.

Background: The emerging infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused an extreme health concern, with many patients having progressed to acute respiratory disease or other complications in a short period. Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive.

Methods: A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis.

Results: The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea ( 2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the non-aggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4(+) T cell count but not the CD8(+) T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4(+) T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.

Conclusions: A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.",研究方向:Health Care Sciences & Services,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,,"作者:Zhou, YL (Zhou, Yulong)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, ZC (Zhang, Zhicheng)[ 2 ] ; Tian, J (Tian, Jie)[ 1 ] ; Xiong, SY (Xiong, Shaoyun)[ 1 ]",ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE,"Ninth Hosp Nanchang, Dept Resp Med, Nanchang 330002, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

A zoonotic coronavirus, tentatively labeled as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.

At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public. It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation. This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health emergencies. (C) 2020 Institut Pasteur.

Objective: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia.

Methods: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb.

Results: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response.

Conclusion: Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds. (C) 2020 Shanghai Changhai Hospital.

Infectious diseases continue to impose unpredictable burdens on global health and economies, a subject that requires constant research and updates. In this sense, the objective of the present article was to review studies on the role of wild animals as reservoirs and/or dispersers of etiological agents of human infectious diseases in order to compile data on the main wild animals and etiological agents involved in zoonotic outbreaks. A systematic review was carried out using PRISMA guidelines, using the PubMed, Scopus and SciELO platforms as data banks. The descriptors used were ""zoonosis"", ""human infectious diseases"" and ""wild animals"". The results show that wild animals (mainly bats, birds and primates) play an important role in the dissemination of etiological agents (mainly viruses, as a new coronavirus called 2019 Novel Coronavirus) in extensive geographic regions. Moreover, these wild animal organisms can act as the site for essential biotic synergy among several pathogenic microorganisms, promoting a higher rate of adaptation, mutation and even genetic recombination, with consequent stimulation of new strains and subtypes, inducing new infectious agents with unknown virulent potential. In conclusion, the monitoring of these diseases and adequate preparation for possible epidemics and pandemics are fundamental conditions for the mitigation of their future impact.

","The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): Novel Virus, Old Challenges"
,10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760,"摘要
2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (31) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 31 Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 31 Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.",研究方向:Emergency Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,,"作者:Koenig, KL (Koenig, Kristi L.)[ 1,2 ] ; Bey, CK (Bey, Christian K.)[ 3 ] ; McDonald, EC (McDonald, Eric C.)[ 4 ]",WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Hlth & Human Serv Agcy, Cty San Diego, Emergency Med Serv, 6255 Mission Gorge Rd, San Diego, CA 92120 USA.

Epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many lives and economy damages. It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed. An experiment that is based on the recent coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan is conducted by applying this methodology. It is shown that an optimized forecasting model that is constructed from a new algorithm, namely polynomial neural network with corrective feedback (PNN+cf) is able to make a forecast that has relatively the lowest prediction error. The results showcase that the newly proposed methodology and PNN+cf are useful in generating acceptable forecast upon the critical time of disease outbreak when the samples are far from abundant.",研究方向:Computer Science,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,,"作者:Fong, SJ (Fong, Simon James)[ 1,2 ] ; Li, G (Li, Gloria)[ 2 ] ; Dey, N (Dey, Nilanjan)[ 3 ] ; Crespo, RG (Gonzalez Crespo, Ruben)[ 4 ] ; Herrera-Viedma, E (Herrera-Viedma, Enrique)[ 5 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Macau, Peoples R China.

",Finding an Accurate Early Forecasting Model from Small Dataset: A Case of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak
,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9,"摘要
Background Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.

Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).

Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2.68 (95% CrI 2.47-2.86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8-7.1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks.

Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far. Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.

Background The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19. With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. Methods All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution. Findings The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",文献类型:Article,出版年: MAY 2020,,"作者:Xu, X (Xu, Xi)[ 1 ] ; Yu, CC (Yu, Chengcheng)[ 2 ] ; Qu, J (Qu, Jing)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, LG (Zhang, Lieguang)[ 2 ] ; Jiang, SF (Jiang, Songfeng)[ 2 ] ; Huang, DY (Huang, Deyang)[ 2 ] ; Chen, BH (Chen, Bihua)[ 2 ] ; Zhang, ZP (Zhang, Zhiping)[ 2 ] ; Guan, WH (Guan, Wanhua)[ 2 ] ; Ling, ZK (Ling, Zhoukun)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING,"Jinan Univ, Dept Med Imaging Ctr, Affiliated Hosp 1, 613,Huangpu Rd West, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Background As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. Methods In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R-0) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. Results The value of R-0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. Conclusions Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.",研究方向:Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 28 2020,Xiamen New Coronavirus Prevention and Control Emergency Tackling Special Topic Program ,"作者:Chen, TM (Chen, Tian-Mu)[ 1 ] ; Rui, J (Rui, Jia)[ 1 ] ; Wang, QP (Wang, Qiu-Peng)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, ZY (Zhao, Ze-Yu)[ 1 ] ; Cui, JA (Cui, Jing-An)[ 2 ] ; Yin, L (Yin, Ling)[ 3 ]",INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY,"Xiamen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, State Key Lab Mol Vaccinol & Mol Diagnost, 4221-117 South Xiangan Rd, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; formally known as 2019-nCoV) has become a most challenging health emergency. Owing to rigorous quarantine and control measures taken in China, routine neonatal health surveillance and follow-up have become challenging. Without follow-up surveillance, some rapid and progressive newborn diseases, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, may be ignored. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, we developed an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of bilirubin level of newborns that is based on our practical experiences. The aim is to make our management strategies of neonatal jaundice tailored to the infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 epidemic.",研究方向:Pediatrics,文献类型:Review; Early Access,FEB 2020,Zhejiang University Special Scientific Research Fund for COVID-19 Prevention and Control ,"作者:Ma, XL (Ma, Xiao-Lu)[ 1,2 ] ; Chen, Z (Chen, Zheng)[ 1,2 ] ; Zhu, JJ (Zhu, Jia-Jun)[ 3 ] ; Shen, XX (Shen, Xiao-Xia)[ 1,2 ] ; Wu, MY (Wu, Ming-Yuan)[ 3 ] ; Shi, LP (Shi, Li-Ping)[ 1,2 ] ; Du, LZ (Du, Li-Zhong)[ 1,2 ] ; Fu, JF (Fu, Jun-Fen)[ 1,2 ] ; Shu, Q (Shu, Qiang)[ 1,2 ]",WORLD JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,"Zhejiang Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Hangzhou 310052, Peoples R China.

How to model the 2019 CoronaVirus (2019-nCov) spread in China is one of the most urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics. In this paper, we propose a novel time delay dynamic system with external source to describe the trend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in the newly proposed dynamic system, which can be considered as the suspected people travel to different areas. The numerical simulations exhibit the dynamic system with the external source is more reliable than the one without it, and the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation results with the public data, we suggest that the local government should have some more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of control.",研究方向:Mathematics,文献类型:Article; Early Access,FEB 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Chen, Y (Chen, Yu)[ 1 ] ; Cheng, J (Cheng, Jin)[ 2,3 ] ; Jiang, Y (Jiang, Yu)[ 1 ] ; Liu, KJ (Liu, Keji)[ 4 ]",APPLICABLE ANALYSIS,"Fudan Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2 2020,"United States Department of Health & Human Services

,10,"摘要
An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R-0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R-t. In the first assumption, R-t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R-t = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R-t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R-t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R-t = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R-t to an ideal level and control the infection.",研究方向:Cell Biology,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 24 2020,Medicine and Engineering Interdisciplinary Research Fund of Shanghai Jiao Tong University ,"作者:Wang, HW (Wang, Huwen)[ 1 ] ; Wang, ZZ (Wang, Zezhou)[ 2,3 ] ; Dong, YQ (Dong, Yinqiao)[ 4 ] ; Chang, RJ (Chang, Ruijie)[ 1 ] ; Xu, C (Xu, Chen)[ 1 ] ; Yu, XY (Yu, Xiaoyue)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, SX (Zhang, Shuxian)[ 1 ] ; Tsamlag, L (Tsamlag, Lhakpa)[ 1 ] ; Shang, ML (Shang, Meili)[ 5 ] ; Huang, JY (Huang, Jinyan)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",CELL DISCOVERY,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Sch Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.

It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the final infection. To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.","研究方向:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 24 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Xu, H (Xu, Hao)[ 1 ] ; Zhong, L (Zhong, Liang)[ 1 ] ; Deng, JX (Deng, Jiaxin)[ 1 ] ; Peng, JK (Peng, Jiakuan)[ 1 ] ; Dan, HX (Dan, Hongxia)[ 1 ] ; Zeng, X (Zeng, Xin)[ 1 ] ; Li, TW (Li, Taiwen)[ 1 ] ; Chen, QM (Chen, Qianming)[ 1 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCE,"Sichuan Univ, Res Unit Oral Carcinogenesis & Management, Natl Clin Res Ctr Oral Dis, Chinese Acad Med Sci,State Key Lab Oral Dis,West, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8,"摘要
Background In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.

Methods We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.

Findings The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99.98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.

Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 22 2020,National Key Research and Development Program of China ,"作者:Lu, RJ (Lu, Roujian)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, X (Zhao, Xiang)[ 1 ] ; Li, J (Li, Juan)[ 2 ] ; Niu, PH (Niu, Peihua)[ 1 ] ; Yang, B (Yang, Bo)[ 3 ] ; Wu, HL (Wu, Honglong)[ 4 ] ; Wang, WL (Wang, Wenling)[ 1 ] ; Song, H (Song, Hao)[ 5 ] ; Huang, BY (Huang, Baoying)[ 1 ] ; Zhu, N (Zhu, Na)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",LANCET,"Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Viral Dis Control & Prevent, NHC Key Lab Biosafety, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.

First reported from Wuhan, The People's Republic of China, on 31 December 2019, the ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes great global concerns. Based on the advice of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee and the fact that to date 24 other countries also reported cases, the WHO Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. Together with the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2019-nCov and other yet to be identified coronaviruses pose a global threat to public health. In this mini-review, we provide a brief introduction to the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and extrapolate this knowledge to the newly identified 2019-nCoV.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAY 2020,National Scientific and Technological Major Project of China ,"作者:Liu, J (Liu, Jia)[ 1,3 ] ; Zheng, X (Zheng, Xin)[ 1,3 ] ; Tong, QX (Tong, Qiaoxia)[ 1 ] ; Li, W (Li, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Wang, BJ (Wang, Baoju)[ 1,3 ] ; Sutter, K (Sutter, Kathrin)[ 2,3 ] ; Trilling, M (Trilling, Mirko)[ 2,3 ] ; Lu, MJ (Lu, Mengji)[ 2,3 ] ; Dittmer, U (Dittmer, Ulf)[ 2,3 ] ; Yang, DL (Yang, Dongliang)[ 1,3 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Union Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, Peoples R China.

In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. A previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through the use of unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing. (Funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China.)

For the third time in as many decades, a zoonotic coronavirus has crossed species to infect human populations. This virus, provisionally called 2019-nCoV, was first identified in Wuhan, China, in persons exposed to a seafood or wet market. The rapid response of the Chinese public health, clinical, and scientific communities facilitated recognition of the clinical disease and initial understanding of the epidemiology of the infection.

An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019. With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred. At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020. At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO. It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought. Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control. More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina.

There is a rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAY 2020,"Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)","作者:Ceraolo, C (Ceraolo, Carmine)[ 1 ] ; Giorgi, FM (Giorgi, Federico M.)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Univ Bologna, Dept Pharm & Biotechnol, Via Selmi 3, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.

There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 17 other countries. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak sites and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the virology, epidemiology, clinical management strategies from both English and Chinese literature, official news channels, and other official government documents.

,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5,"摘要
Background A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.

Methods All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.

Findings By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49.0 years (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF alpha.

Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Background In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.

Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.

Findings Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55.5 years (SD 13.1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneu-mothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.

Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the genetic diversity, time origin, and evolutionary history of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and Thailand, a total of 12 genome sequences of the virus with known sampling date (24 December 2019 and 13 January 2020) and geographic location (primarily Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, but also Bangkok, Thailand) were analyzed. Phylogenetic and likelihood-mapping analyses of these genome sequences were performed. On the basis of our results, the star-like signal and topology of 2019-nCoV may be indicative of potentially large ""first generation"" human-to-human virus transmission. We estimated that 2019-nCoV likely originated in Wuhan on 9 November 2019 (95% credible interval: 25 September 2019 and 19 December 2019), and that Wuhan is the major hub for the spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and elsewhere.

To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed. Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. On the basis of the likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 x 10(-3) to 1.8266 x 10(-3) substitutions per site per year. On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV transmission in real-time.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAY 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Li, XG (Li, Xingguang)[ 1 ] ; Wang, W (Wang, Wei)[ 2 ] ; Zhao, XF (Zhao, Xiaofang)[ 3 ] ; Zai, JJ (Zai, Junjie)[ 4 ] ; Zhao, Q (Zhao, Qiang)[ 5 ] ; Li, Y (Li, Yi)[ 1 ] ; Chaillon, A (Chaillon, Antoine)[ 6 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Wuhan Univ Bioengn, Hubei Engn Res Ctr Viral Vector, Wuhan 430415, Peoples R China.

Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the Wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first Disease X. Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 2019-nCoV, which has 79.5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting its potential bat origin. With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics and prophylactics. Here we suggest renaming 2019-nCoV as ""transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)"" and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 2019-nCoV.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Review; Early Access,FEB 2020,,"作者:Jiang, SB (Jiang, Shibo)[ 1,2 ] ; Shi, ZL (Shi, Zheng-Li)[ 3 ]",VIROLOGICA SINICA,"Fudan Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Key Lab Med Mol Virol MOE NHC CAMS, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.

A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration between all parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging threats is required to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 13 2020,,"作者:Stoecklin, SB (Stoecklin, Sibylle Bernard)[ 1 ] ; Rolland, P (Rolland, Patrick)[ 2 ] ; Silue, Y (Silue, Yassoungo)[ 3 ] ; Mailles, A (Mailles, Alexandra)[ 1 ] ; Campese, C (Campese, Christine)[ 1 ] ; Simondon, A (Simondon, Anne)[ 4 ] ; Mechain, M (Mechain, Matthieu)[ 5 ] ; Meurice, L (Meurice, Laure)[ 6 ] ; Nguyen, M (Nguyen, Mathieu)[ 5 ] ; Bassi, C (Bassi, Clement)[ 3 ] ...更多内容",EUROSURVEILLANCE,"Sante Publ France, Direct Malad Infect, St Maurice, France.

Objectives The purpose of this study was to observe the imaging characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Methods Sixty-three confirmed patients were enrolled from December 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. Results CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean age was 44.9 +/- 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 +/- 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients had patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, 14 (22.2%) patients had GGO, 12 (19.0%) patients had patchy consolidation, 11 (17.5%) patients had fibrous stripes and 8 (12.7%) patients had irregular solid nodules. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients progressed, including single GGO increased, enlarged and consolidated; fibrous stripe enlarged, while solid nodules increased and enlarged. Conclusions Imaging changes in novel viral pneumonia are rapid. The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse. Imaging changes of typical viral pneumonia and some specific imaging features were observed. Therefore, we need to strengthen the recognition of image changes to help clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately.","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",文献类型:Article; Early Access,FEB 2020,,"作者:Pan, YY (Pan, Yueying)[ 1 ] ; Guan, HX (Guan, Hanxiong)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, SC (Zhou, Shuchang)[ 1 ] ; Wang, YJ (Wang, Yujin)[ 1 ] ; Li, Q (Li, Qian)[ 1 ] ; Zhu, TT (Zhu, Tingting)[ 1 ] ; Hu, QJ (Hu, Qiongjie)[ 1 ] ; Xia, LM (Xia, Liming)[ 1 ]",EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,"Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Dept Radiol, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.

To help health workers and the public recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) quickly, effectively, and calmly with an updated understanding. A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official websites and announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 am 26 January 2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019-nCoV and the current outbreak was drawn. Up to 24 pm, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of 2019-nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of 2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range 48-89) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms among those who died. The median number of days from the occurence of the first symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6-41) days, and it tended to be shorter among people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those aged less than 70 years (20 [range 10-41] days; P = .033). The 2019-nCoV infection is spreading and its incidence is increasing nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in elderly people, among whom the disease might progress faster. The public should still be cautious in dealing with the virus and pay more attention to protecting the elderly people from the virus.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Wang, WE (Wang, Weier)[ 1,2 ] ; Tang, JM (Tang, Jianming)[ 3 ] ; Wei, FQ (Wei, Fangqiang)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Hangzhou Med Coll, Zhejiang Prov Peoples Hosp, Dept Hepatobiliary & Pancreat Surg, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAY 2020,,"作者:Giovanetti, M (Giovanetti, Marta)[ 1 ] ; Benvenuto, D (Benvenuto, Domenico)[ 2 ] ; Angeletti, S (Angeletti, Silvia)[ 3 ] ; Ciccozzi, M (Ciccozzi, Massimo)[ 2 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Univ Campus Biomed Rome, Unit Clin Lab Sci, I-00128 Rome, Italy.

A global health emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization as the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads across the world, with confirmed patients in Canada. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.",研究方向:Anesthesiology,文献类型:Review,出版年: MAY 2020,,"作者:Wax, RS (Wax, Randy S.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Christian, MD (Christian, Michael D.)[ 4 ]",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE,"Queens Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Crit Care Med, Kingston, ON, Canada.

The global spread of the 2019-nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high. In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank. We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25(th), 2019. These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus. Moreover, our study describes the same population genetic dynamic underlying the SARS 2003 epidemic, and suggests the urgent need for the development of effective molecular surveillance strategies of Betacoronavirus among animals and Rhinolophus of the bat family.","研究方向:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine",文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 17 2020,,"作者:Benvenuto, D (Benvenuto, Domenico)[ 1 ] ; Giovanetti, M (Giovanetti, Marta)[ 2 ] ; Salemi, M (Salemi, Marco)[ 3,4 ] ; Prosperi, M (Prosperi, Mattia)[ 3,4 ] ; De Flora, C (De Flora, Cecilia)[ 1 ] ; Alcantara, LC (Junior Alcantara, Luiz Carlos)[ 2 ] ; Angeletti, S (Angeletti, Silvia)[ 5 ] ; Ciccozzi, M (Ciccozzi, Massimo)[ 2 ]",PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH,"Univ Campus Biomed Rome, Unit Clin Lab Sci, Rome, Italy.

In December 2019, a viral pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China. We report the epidemiological and clinical features of the first patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia imported into Korea from Wuhan.

The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries. Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China. All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity. ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury. Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity. Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury. Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.",研究方向:Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,National Science and Technology Major Project ,"作者:Liu, YX (Liu, Yingxia)[ 1 ] ; Yang, Y (Yang, Yang)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Zhang, C (Zhang, Cong)[ 4 ] ; Huang, FM (Huang, Fengming)[ 4 ] ; Wang, FX (Wang, Fuxiang)[ 1 ] ; Yuan, J (Yuan, Jing)[ 1 ] ; Wang, ZQ (Wang, Zhaoqin)[ 1 ] ; Li, JX (Li, Jinxiu)[ 1 ] ; Li, JM (Li, Jianming)[ 1 ] ; Feng, C (Feng, Cheng)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES,"Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Key Lab Pathogen & Immun, State Key Discipline Infect Dis,Shenzhen Peoples, Natl Clin Res Ctr Infect Dis,Hosp Affiliated 1, Shenzhen 518112, Peoples R China.

There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, 12 whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARS-like coronavirus). Fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019-nCoV significantly clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. From these results, the new 2019-nCoV is distinct from SARS virus, probably trasmitted from bats after mutation conferring ability to infect humans.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Benvenuto, D (Benvenuto, Domenico)[ 1 ] ; Giovanetti, M (Giovanetti, Marta)[ 2 ] ; Ciccozzi, A (Ciccozzi, Alessandra)[ 1 ] ; Spoto, S (Spoto, Silvia)[ 3 ] ; Angeletti, S (Angeletti, Silvia)[ 4 ] ; Ciccozzi, M (Ciccozzi, Massimo)[ 2 ]",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY,"Univ Campus Biomed Rome, Unit Clin Lab Sci, I-00128 Rome, Italy.

For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections.

Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health. Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described.

Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health(1-3). Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing(4) of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV'). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China(5). This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,Special National Project on investigation of basic resources of China ,"作者:Wu, F (Wu, Fan)[ 1 ] ; Zhao, S (Zhao, Su)[ 2 ] ; Yu, B (Yu, Bin)[ 3 ] ; Chen, YM (Chen, Yan-Mei)[ 1 ] ; Wang, W (Wang, Wen)[ 4 ] ; Song, ZG (Song, Zhi-Gang)[ 1 ] ; Hu, Y (Hu, Yi)[ 2 ] ; Tao, ZW (Tao, Zhao-Wu)[ 2 ] ; Tian, JH (Tian, Jun-Hua)[ 3 ] ; Pei, YY (Pei, Yuan-Yuan)[ 1 ] ...更多内容",NATURE,"Fudan Univ, Shanghai Publ Hlth Clin Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

,10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7,"摘要
Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats(1-4). Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans(5-7). Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.",研究方向:Science & Technology - Other Topics,文献类型:Article,出版年: MAR 2020,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) ,"作者:Zhou, P (Zhou, Peng)[ 1 ] ; Yang, XL (Yang, Xing-Lou)[ 1 ] ; Wang, XG (Wang, Xian-Guang)[ 2 ] ; Hu, B (Hu, Ben)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, L (Zhang, Lei)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, W (Zhang, Wei)[ 1 ] ; Si, HR (Si, Hao-Rui)[ 1,3 ] ; Zhu, Y (Zhu, Yan)[ 1 ] ; Li, B (Li, Bei)[ 1 ] ; Huang, CL (Huang, Chao-Lin)[ 2 ] ...更多内容",NATURE,"Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Inst Virol, Ctr Biosafety Mega Sci, CAS Key Lab Special Pathogens, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

Background: The newly identified 2019-nCoV, which appears to have originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China, is spreading rapidly nationwide. A number of cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded. However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019nCoV infections in neonates.

Methods: The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 toFebruary 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.

Results: Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases. In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea. Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins. Of the neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90. Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 9 of the 10 neonates 1 to 9 days after birth for nucleic acid amplification tests for 2019-nCoV, all of which showed negative results.

Conclusions: Perinatal 2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death. However, vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed.",研究方向:Pediatrics,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 2020,,"作者:Zhu, HP (Zhu, Huaping)[ 1 ] ; Wang, L (Wang, Lin)[ 2 ] ; Fang, CZ (Fang, Chengzhi)[ 3 ] ; Peng, SC (Peng, Sicong)[ 1 ] ; Zhang, LH (Zhang, Lianhong)[ 4 ] ; Chang, GP (Chang, Guiping)[ 5 ] ; Xia, SW (Xia, Shiwen)[ 1 ] ; Zhou, WH (Zhou, Wenhao)[ 6 ]",TRANSLATIONAL PEDIATRICS,"Maternal & Child Hlth Hosp Hubei Prov, Dept Neonatol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.

In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.",研究方向:Virology,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 2020,,"作者:Schwartz, DA (Schwartz, David A.)[ 1 ] ; Graham, AL (Graham, Ashley L.)[ 2 ]",VIRUSES-BASEL,"Augusta Univ, Med Coll Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.

The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new coronavirus spreading quickly across China and affecting at least 24 other countries. With almost 65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February 2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population, COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002-2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,文献类型:Editorial Material,出版年: FEB 2020,,"作者:Goh, GKM (Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng)[ 1 ] ; Dunker, AK (Dunker, A.

After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date for data collection.

As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China. At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.",研究方向:Microbiology,文献类型:Review,出版年: FEB 2020,"Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University ","作者:Shanmugaraj, B (Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan)[ 1,2 ] ; Malla, A (Malla, Ashwini)[ 1,2 ] ; Phoolcharoen, W (Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo)[ 1,2 ]",PATHOGENS,"Chulalongkorn Univ, Res Unit Plant Produced Pharmaceut, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of lab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARSCoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense.

OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data on the global outbreak of ""2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV"" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.

RESULTS: Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7. 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills. cough. shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.",研究方向:Pharmacology & Pharmacy,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 2020,Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University,"作者:Meo, SA (Meo, S.

With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 17-53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Review,出版年: FEB 2020,,"作者:Arabi, YM (Arabi, Yaseen M.)[ 1,2,3 ] ; Fowler, R (Fowler, Robert)[ 4,5,6 ] ; Hayden, FG (Hayden, Frederick G.)[ 7 ]",INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE,"King Saud Bin Abdulaziz Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Med, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Review,出版年: FEB 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Deng, SQ (Deng, Sheng-Qun)[ 1 ] ; Peng, HJ (Peng, Hong-Juan)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,"Southern Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Pathogen Biol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Trop Dis Res, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China.

Reanalysis of the epidemic curve from the initial cluster of cases with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 indicates substantial human-to-human transmission. It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market. As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Editorial Material,出版年: FEB 2020,Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED),"作者:Nishiura, H (Nishiura, Hiroshi)[ 1,2 ] ; Linton, NM (Linton, Natalie M.)[ 1 ] ; Akhmetzhanov, AR (Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.)[ 1 ]",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,"Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Med, Kita Ku, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.

All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections.

Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 2020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,"作者:Tang, B (Tang, Biao)[ 1,2 ] ; Wang, X (Wang, Xia); Li, Q (Li, Qian)[ 2,3,4 ] ; Bragazzi, NL (Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi)[ 2 ] ; Tang, SY (Tang, Sanyi)[ 3 ] ; Xiao, YN (Xiao, Yanni)[ 1,4 ] ; Wu, JH (Wu, Jianhong)[ 1,2,5 ]",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,"Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Math & Life Sci, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.

The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500 confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]). This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 2020,"Christ Church, Oxford, via a Junior Research Fellowship ","作者:Thompson, RN (Thompson, Robin N.)[ 1,2 ]",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,"Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.

Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R-0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R-0. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18-25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R-0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63).

Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in China. Two cases of neonates with positive 2019-nCoV tests have been reported. Due to the immature immune system and the possibility of vertical transmission from mother to infant, neonates have become a high-risk group susceptible to 2019-nCoV, which emphasize a close cooperation from both perinatal and neonatal pediatrics. In neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), to prevent and control infection, there should be practical measures to ensure the optimal management of children potentially to be infected. According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Chinese Neonatal 2019-nCoV expert working Group has put forward measures on the prevention and control of neonatal 2019-nCoV infection.",研究方向:Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: FEB 2020,,"作者:Wang, LS (Wang, Laishuan)[ 1 ] ; Shi, Y (Shi, Yuan)[ 2 ] ; Xiao, TT (Xiao, Tiantian)[ 3 ] ; Fu, JH (Fu, Jianhua)[ 4 ] ; Feng, X (Feng, Xing)[ 5 ] ; Mu, DZ (Mu, Dezhi)[ 6 ] ; Feng, Q (Feng, Qi)[ 7 ] ; Hei, MY (Hei, Mingyan)[ 8 ] ; Hu, XJ (Hu, Xiaojing)[ 1 ] ; Li, ZK (Li, Zhankui)[ 9 ] ...更多内容",ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,"Fudan Univ, Dept Pediat, Childrens Hosp, Shanghai 201102, Peoples R China.

Background: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur. Aim: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. Methods: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results: The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available through European Virus Archive - Global ( EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project.

Objectives We aimed to evaluate the agreement in the detection of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) between conventional susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and fast SWI using wave-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) acceleration. We also scrutinized the diagnostic agreement for intracranial lesions and compared the image quality between both sequences. Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was waived for this retrospective study. We included 181 consecutive patients who had undergone brain MRI with both conventional SWI (scan time, 251 s) and wave-CAIPI SWI (scan time, 113 s) from September 2017 to November 2017. All images were independently reviewed by two radiologists for the detection and counting of CMBs using the Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale (MARS). One neuroradiologist diagnosed intracranial lesions and scored image quality using visual analysis. The agreement for detection of CMBs and intracranial lesions was calculated, and interobserver agreements were analyzed by using kappa and intraclass correlation. Results For detection of CMBs, both the conventional and wave-CAIPI SWI showed significantly high agreement of 100% for the presence of CMBs, and 94.5% using MARS. Wave-CAIPI SWI achieved more than 97% agreement of MARS when divided by anatomical locations, with excellent agreement. Interobserver agreements were also excellent. The diagnosis for intracranial lesions (33 lesions in 28 patients) demonstrated 100% agreement. The image quality of both sequences is not significantly different (p = 0.20). Conclusions Wave-CAIPI SWI achieved high agreement for CMB detection and diagnosis of intracranial lesions compared to conventional SWI within half of the scan time.","研究方向:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",文献类型:Article,出版年: APR 2020,,"作者:Chung, MS (Chung, Mi Sun)[ 1 ] ; Lee, EJ (Lee, Eun Jung)[ 1 ] ; Kim, S (Kim, Sujin)[ 1 ] ; Kim, SO (Kim, Seon-Ok)[ 2 ] ; Byun, JS (Byun, Jun Soo)[ 1 ]",EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,"Chung Ang Univ, Chung Ang Univ Hosp, Dept Radiol, Coll Med, 102 Heukseok Ro, Seoul, South Korea.

Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed. Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced.",研究方向:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,文献类型:Review,出版年: 2020,Macau Science and Technology Development Fund (FDCT) ,"作者:Yang, Y (Yang, Yang)[ 1 ] ; Islam, MS (Islam, Md Sahidul)[ 1 ] ; Wang, J (Wang, Jin)[ 1 ] ; Li, Y (Li, Yuan)[ 1 ] ; Chen, X (Chen, Xin)[ 1 ]",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Univ Macau, Inst Chinese Med Sci, Ave Univ, Taipa 999078, Macao, Peoples R China.

On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that humanto-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronaviruglaboratory-diagnostics-for-novel-coronavirus.",研究方向:Infectious Diseases,文献类型:Article,出版年: JAN 2020,Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in the Molecular Pathogenesis of Emerging and Re-Emerging Viruses by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ,"作者:Ralph, R (Ralph, Robyn)[ 1,2 ] ; Lew, J (Lew, Jocelyne)[ 1 ] ; Zeng, TS (Zeng, Tiansheng)[ 3 ] ; Francis, M (Francis, Magie)[ 4 ] ; Xue, B (Xue, Bei)[ 3,4 ] ; Roux, M (Roux, Melissa)[ 4 ] ; Ostadgavahi, AT (Ostadgavahi, Ali Toloue)[ 4 ] ; Rubino, S (Rubino, Salvatore)[ 5 ] ; Dawe, NJ (Dawe, Nicholas J.)[ 4 ] ; Al-Ahdal, MN (Al-Ahdal, Mohammed N.)[ 6 ] ...更多内容",JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,"Dalhousie Univ, Dept Pediat, Fac Med, IWK Hlth Ctr, 5980 Univ Ave,4th Floor,R4020, Halifax, NS B3K 6R8, Canada.

Coronavirus (CoV) has been one of the major pandemic threats to human health in the last two decades. The human coronavirus was first identified in 1960s. CoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have caused numerous disasters or human deaths worldwide. Recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2, early named 2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, China, and it had caused 81238 cases of confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until March 19, 2020. Its risks and pandemic potential have brought global consideration.

In the Wuhan Province of China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract leading to an acute respiratory syndrome. Subsequently, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provoked a pandemic which is considered a life-threatening disease. The SARS-CoV-2, a family member of betacoronaviruses, possesses single-stranded positive-sense RNA with typical structural proteins, involving the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins that are responsible for the viral infectivity, and nonstructural proteins. The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection. However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines ""cytokine storm"" leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain. The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease. In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Review,出版年: 2020,,"作者:Tufan, A (Tufan, Abdurrahman)[ 1 ] ; Avanoglu Guler, A (Avanoglu Guler, Aslihan)[ 1 ] ; Matucci-Cerinic, M (Matucci-Cerinic, Marco)[ 2 ]",TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES,"Gazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med & Rheumatol, Ankara, Turkey.

Objective To analyze the epidemiological, laboratory and clinical characteristics of confirmed and suspected corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19)patients in Songjiang District, Shanghai in 2019 and discuss the clinical and laboratory characteristics between the two groups, so as to provide a reference for the differential diagnosis, prevention and treatment for COVID-19. Methods The general information, epidemiological, laboratory and clinical characteristics of the confirmed and suspected COVID-19 adult patients admitted to the emergency department of fever in the South Hospital of Shanghai General Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University from January 12, 2020 to February 4, 2020 were collected. Then the differences in epidemiological, laboratory and clinical characteristics between the two groups were described and compared. Results By February 4, 2020, a total of 22 patients were enrolled, among which 7 cases had been identified as 2019 novel corona virus(2019-nCoV)positive and confirmed as COVID-19 patients, 15 cases were suspected patients. The main susceptible population of 7 confirmed patients were middle-aged and elderly and men, 1 case was critical and 1 case was cluster outbreak. Most of the confirmed patients had been to Wuhan or had been exposed to patients with COVID-19 or fever. No body had been exposed to Wuhan Huanan Seafood Market. The time from the history of epidemiological exposure to the onset of symptoms was 1-10 days, with average of(5.4 3.8)days; the median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 5.0(3.0,6.0)days. The main clinical symptoms were fever(7 [100%]),dry cough(6 [85.7%]), chest tightness(3 [42.9%]), diarrhoea(2 [28.6%]), myalgia or fatigue(1 [14.3%]),and dyspnoea(1 [14.3%]). The incidence of dry cough in comfirmed group was significantly higher than that in suspect group [85.7%(6/7)vs. 20.0%(3/15), P < 0.05],without significant difference in other symptoms. Compared with COVID-19 suspected group, the COVID-19 confirmed group had lower white blood cell count, lymphocyte count and lymphopenia cases; while alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, D-dimer and myoglobin were higher in COVID-19 confirmed group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference in other laboratory indexes. Conclusions Clinical symptoms and laboratory tests could help clinicans differentiate 2019-nCoV infection from common winter respiratory diseases, but it was difficult to distinguish it from winter respiratory diseases based on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests alone. Clinical diagnosis still needs to be combined with imaging characteristics and result of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test.

Objective To analyze the clinical features of patients with corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19),and to provide important evidence for the early prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Methods The COVID-19 suspected patients admitted in the Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 24, 2020 to January 30, 2020 were collected. The patients with positive 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV)test results were selected as the COVID-19 confirmed group(12 cases), and those with negative test results were selected as COVID-19 suspected group(50 cases). The medical records, laboratory and supplementary examination results of the two groups were retrospectively analyzed. Results The age of COVID-19 confirmed group was significantly older than that of COVID-19 suspected group [(56.5 15.4)vs.(42.1 17.9)years, P < 0.05], and there was no significant difference in other clinical features(all P > 0.05). All the patients of COVID-19 confirmed group developed fever symptoms, and 7 cases of cough(58.3%), 5 cases of sputum(41.7%), 3 cases of sore throat(25.0%), 2 cases of fatigue(16.7%), and 1 case of myalgia(8.3%). In the COVID-19 confirmed group, the white blood cell count [WBC(*10~9/L): 5.220(4.485,5.950)vs. 8.415(5.448,12.620)], platelet count [PLT(*10~9/L): 163.080 30.414 vs. 228.240 66.811],neutrophil count [*10~9/L: 3.040(2.650,3.818)vs. 5.310(3.433,10.488)], eosinophil count [* 10~9/L: 0.025(0.003,0.478)vs. 0.050(0.018,0.163)], eosinophil percentage [(0.575 0.624)% vs.(1.236 1.408)%], basophil count [*10~9/L: 0.010(0.010, 0.018)vs. 0.020(0.010, 0.040)], and platelet specific volume [0.153(0.135, 0.170)% vs. 0.211(0.172, 0.258)%] were significantly decreased compared with COVID-19 suspectecl group(all P < 0.05), and the percentage of monocytes [(8.692 3.004)% vs.(6.1892.511)%] and percentage of hypersensitive C-reactive protein(hs-CRP)> 10 ng/L [66.7%(8/12)vs. 28.0%(14/50)] significantly increased(all P < 0.05). All 12 cases of 2019-nCoV positive patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT, among which 10 cases with both sides infection(83.3%)and 2 cases with unilateral side infection(16.7%); the lesions of 6 cases were located in the subpleural area(50%), 4 cases in the lower lobe(33.3%), 2 cases in the middle lobe(16.7%), 2 cases in the upper lobe(16.7%), and 2 cases in the extrapulmonary zone(16.7%); the lung lesions of 11 patients(91.7%)showed flaky or plaque like ground glass shadows. Conclusions The patients with 2019-nCoV positive are mostly middle-aged and elderly people, and mostly men. The main symptoms are fever and cough. The blood routine test, hs-CRP, and chest CT can be used as auxiliary indexes of COVID-19.

Objective To explore the measures of safe transportation of febrile patients, control of infection source and protection of susceptible population in pre hospital emergency treatment. Methods In the face of outbreak of corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19)epidemic in Wuhan, a series of prevention and control measures adopted by the Emergency Center of Yunnan Province have contained the serious situation of rapid spread of COVID-19. The approaches were as follows. They formulated the emergency plan, personal protection, and diagnosis and treatment plan, and trained more than 300 medical personnels in the center for twice. Each person must be proficient at mastering the wearing and taking off level 1-3 protective clothing, and using unified indexes as criteria for assessment, conducted a unified assessment for everyone. In actual work, for ordinary febrile patients who called 120, through careful inquiry, to firstly screen whether they have been to Huhei or has been in contact with people from Hubei. The medical staff should take level 1 -3 protection according to the specific situation, the patients should wear 1 -2 medical protective masks, and those who have close contact with febrile patients should he temporarily isolated at home. The patients were sent to the nearest local clinic, waiting to rule out whether infected with 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV). If the 2019-nCoV nuclear acid test was positive, the government of the patient's district should close and isolate the whole unit building, conduct semi closed management for the community, and at the same time do a good job in logistics and life support. Results In 362 febrile patients who were transported, there were more than 50 cases of COVID-19 suspected patients, and 28 patients with 2019-nCoV positive results. In the transfer of confirmed patients with positive results, according to the principle that ""the provincial infectious disease hospital receives the patients in hospital directly under the Provincial Health Committee and the municipal infectious disease hospital receives the patients in hospital directly under the Municipal Health Committee"", the provincial and municipal health authorities should dispatch the three-level protective negative pressure emergency vehicles to send the patients to the provincial infectious disease hospital or the municipal infectious disease hospital about 30 km away from the urban area for specialized treatment. During the transfer of confirmed patients, we deliberately understood the abstract plan of the treatment room of the ambulance as ""medical staff passage"" and ""patient passage"", the medical staff get on and off from the middle door, and the patients uniformly exits from the relatively polluted back door. We should pay attention to three tasks such as preparation before transfer, treatment during transfer and disinfection after transfer. Conclusions At present, with the coordinated management of the government and the active cooperation of the broad masses, it is being implemented steadily with good results. At the same time, it lays a solid foundation and provides experiences for the transfer of various infectious patients in the future.
摘要:目的探讨院前急救中安全转运发热患者、控制传染源、保护易感人群的转运措施。方法面对武汉的新型冠状病毒肺炎(简称新冠肺炎)疫情传播,云南省急救中心采取了一系列防控应对措施,对新冠肺炎快速传播的严重态势起到了遏制作用。具体做法:制定应急预案、个人防护、诊疗方案,并对全中心300余名医护人员进行了 2次全员培训,要求每个人都必须熟练掌握1~3级防护衣物的穿脱要求,并以统一指标要求作为通过标准,进行人人过关的考核。在转运中,对于普通发热患者呼叫120后,通过仔细询问了解,初步筛查患者是否到过湖北或接触过来自湖北的人员,医务人员视具体情况采取1~3级防护,让患者佩戴1~2个医用防护口罩,嘱托与发热患者有密切接触的人员暂时居家隔离,按照属地化就近原则将患者送至附近发热门诊等待排查是否感染新型冠状病毒(2019-nCoV),如果2019-nCoV核酸检测结果为阳性,由患者居住地辖区政府对整个单元楼或整栋楼房实施封闭隔离,并对该小区进行半封闭式管理,同时做好后勤生活保障工作。结果在转运的362例发热患者中,有50余例为疑似新冠肺炎,有28例为2019-nCoV核酸检测阳性患者。对阳性确诊患者的转运,则按照省传染病医院接收省卫健委直属医院、市传染病医院接收市卫健委直属医院的原则,由省、市两级卫生主管部门调派3级防护用负压急救车,将患者送至距市区约30公里的省传染病医院或市传染病医院进行专科治疗。在确诊患者的转运中,将急救车的治疗仓抽象地规划理解为医务人员通道和患者通道,即医务人员从负压车的中门上下车,患者统一从相对污染的后门上下车,注重做好转送前准备、转送中治疗、转送后消毒3个环节的工作。结论目前在政府协调管理、广大群众的积极配合下,该措施正在稳步实施,收效甚好,同时也为今后转送各类传染病患者奠定了坚实的基础,积累了许多值得借鉴的经验。",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: 2020,,作者:Zhu Yongfu; Li Shilin; Tian Yongcan; Zong Kai; Wang Weixu; Zhang Tairui; Long Meiyun; Wang Xin; Mu Lihua,Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine in Intensive and Critical Care,"地址: Zhu Yongfu, The Emergency Center of Yunnan Province, Kunming, Yunnan 650106, China.

In December 2019,a new coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province. The World Health Organization(WHO)named it 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV). Due to insufficient understanding of corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19), the clinical manifestations are diverse, making treatment difficult. The author analyzed the clinical manifestations, laboratory test results of a patient with COVID-19, especially the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio(NLR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein(hs-CRP), and the dynamic evolution results of CT images, and found that NLR and hs-CRP has a guiding role in clinical treatment during the course of disease transformation.

For personnel unrelated with Wuhan, most of the patients with corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19)have a clear history of travel in Wuhan or an epidemiological history of contact with relevant personnel. Most of the patients have different degrees of fever, cough, expectoration and other clinical symptoms, and most of the patients have typical pulmonary imaging manifestations in the whole course of the disease, and finally confirmed by 2019 novel corona virus(2019-nCoV)nucleic acid detection. This paper reports the epidemiological history and treatment experience of a COVID-19 patient with atypical features in lung in Lishui District, Zhejiang Province, who was also the first confirmed and discharged patient in this city. The patient had a typical history of traveling in Wuhan and typical symptoms of fever, cough and expectoration, the hematological test indexes were basically in the normal range, the antigen tests of influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were all negative, and there was no significant change in lung imaging. However, the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection was positive, and the patient was confirmed with COVID-19. It only took 5 days from the fever and diagnosis for patient's the cure and discharge. After antiviral treatment, the nucleic acid test turned negative and the patient reached the cure standard.

Corona virus disease 2019(COVID-2019)is an acute respiratory tract infectious disease caused by infection with 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV), which is mainly characterized with pulmonary inflammatory lesions, strong infectivity and long incubation period. At present, the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-2019 is positive nucleic acid test result. However, nucleic acid test results of some patients are false negative, and the number of patients need to be screened is so large. For asymptomatic patients and the large number of patients needed to be screened, imaging examinations are particularly important. The main points of CT and ultrasonic examination in auxiliary diagnosis of COVID-2019, the advantages of ultrasonic examination and protective specifications were reviewed in this article.

2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a highly pathogenic human CoV that first emerged in Wuhan in 2019.2019-nCoV has a zoonotic origin and poses a major threat to public health.However,little is known about the viral factors contributing to the high virulence of 2019-nCoV.Many animal viruses,including CoVs,encode proteins that interfere with host gene expression,including those involved in antiviral immune responses,and these viral proteins are often major virulence factors.Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known respiratory pathogens associated with a range of respiratory infection.In the past 17 years,the onset of 2019-nCoV,severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have thrust HCoVs into spotlight of the research community due to their high pathogenicity in humans.The recent study of HCoVs-host interactions has contributed extensively to our understanding of infection pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV.This review discuss various host physiopathologic mechanism,such as apoptosis,innate immunity,endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response,mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway that may be modulated by HCoVs and provides evidence for the intensive investigate of 2019-nCoV infection.
摘要:在武汉首次出现的2019新型冠状病毒(2019-novel coronavirus,2019-nCoV)是一种高致病性人类冠状病毒(human coronaviruses,HCoVs) 。 HCoV感染属人畜共患病,对公共卫生构成重大威胁。然而,对导致这次2019-nCoV的高侵袭力了解甚少。许多动物源性病毒编码的蛋白干扰了宿主抗病毒免疫应答,这些病毒蛋白通常是主要的毒力因子。人类冠状病毒是与呼吸道感染相关的病原体。在过去的17年中,2019-nCoV、严重急性呼吸综合征冠状病毒(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,SARS-CoV)和中东呼吸综合征冠状病毒(Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,MERS-CoV)感染人类的事件相继暴发,使HCoV成为研究领域的热点。HCoV与宿主相互作用的研究有助于理解本次2019-nCoV感染的发病机制。本综述涉及近年来HCoV感染对宿主细胞凋亡、固有免疫应答、内质网应激应答、丝裂原激活蛋白激酶(mitogen-activated protein kinase,MAPK)和核因子kappa B (nuclear factor kappa B,NF-KB)信号通路等多层次影响的研究进展,为今后深入研究2019-nCoV感染发病机制提供参考。",研究方向:General & Internal Medicine,文献类型:Article,出版年: 2020,,作者:Gu Yanni; Shen Chaobin; Chen Tongxin,Chinese Journal of Applied Clinical Pediatrics,"地址: Gu Yanni, Shanghai TCM-Integrated Hospital,Shanghai University of TCM, Shanghai 200082, China.
